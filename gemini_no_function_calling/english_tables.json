Data collection for the agricultural census is part of a combined data collection for a.o. agricultural policy use and enforcement of the manure law.\n\nRegional breakdown is based on the main location of the holding. Due to this the region where activities (crops, animals) are allocated may differ from the location where these activities actually occur.\n\nThe agricultural census is also used as the basis for the European Farm Structure Survey (FSS). Data from the agricultural census do not fully coincide with the FSS. In the FSS years (2000, 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2010)  additional information was collected to meet the requirements of the FSS.\n\nReference date for livestock is 1 April and for crops 15 May.\n\nIn 2022, equidae are not part of the Agricultural Census. This affects the farm type and the total number of farms in the Agricultural Census. Farms with horses, ponies and donkeys that were previously classified as \u2018specialist grazing livestock' could be classified, according to their dominant activity, as another farm type in 2022.\n\nFrom 2020 onwards, the SO2017, based on the years 2015 to 2019, will apply (see also the explanation for SO: Standard Output).\n\nFrom 2018 onwards the number of calves for fattening, pigs for fattening, chicken and turkey are adjusted in the case of temporary breaks in the production cycle (e.g. sanitary cleaning).\nThe agricultural census is a structural survey, in which adjustment for temporary breaks in the production cycle is a.o. relevant for the calculation of the economic size of the holding, and its farm type.\nIn the livestock surveys the number of animals on the reference day is relevant, therefore no adjustment for temporary breaks in the production cycle are made.\nThis means that the number of animals in the tables of the agricultural census may differ from those in the livestock tables (see \u2018links to relevant tables and relevant articles).\n\nFrom 2017 onwards, animal numbers are increasingly derived from I&R registers (Identification and Registration of animals), instead of by means of the combined data collection. The I&R registers are the responsibility of RVO (Netherlands Enterprise Agency). Since 2017, cattle numbers are derived from I&R cattle, and from 2018 sheep, goats and poultry are also derived from the relevant I&R registers. The registration of cattle, sheep and goats takes place directly at RVO. Poultry data is collected via the designated database Poultry Information System Poultry (KIP) from Avined. Avined is a branch organization for the egg and poultry meat sectors. Avined passes the data on to the central database of RVO. Due to the transition to the use of I&R registers, a change in classification will occur for sheep and goats from 2018 onwards.\n\nSince 2016, information of the Dutch Business Register is used  to define the agricultural census. Registration in the Business Register with an agricultural standard industrial classification code (SIC), related to NACE/ISIC, (in Dutch SBI: \u2018Standaard BedrijfsIndeling\u2019) is leading to determine whether there is an agricultural holding. This aligns the agricultural census  as closely as possible to the statistical regulations of Eurostat and the (Dutch) implementation of the definition of 'active farmer' as described in the common agricultural policy.\n\nThe  definition of the agricultural census based on information from the Dutch Business Register mainly affects the number of holdings, a clear deviation of the trend occurs. The impact on areas (except for other land and rough grazing) and the number of animals (except for sheep, horses and ponies) is limited. This is mainly due  to the holdings that are excluded as a result of the new delimitation of  agricultural holdings (such as equestrian centres, city farms and organisations in nature management).\n\nIn 2011 there were changes in geographic assignment of holdings with a foreign main seat. This may influence regional figures, mainly in border regions.\n\nUntil 2010 the economic size of agricultural holdings was expressed in Dutch size units (in Dutch NGE: 'Nederlandse Grootte Eenheid').

The energy supply is equal to the indigenous production of energy plus the receipts minus the deliveries of energy plus the stock changes. Consumption of energy is equal to the sum of own use, distribution losses, final energy consumption, non-energy use and the total net energy transformation. For each sector, the supply of energy is equal to the consumption of energy.\n\nFor some energy commodities, the total of the observed domestic deliveries is not exactly equal to the sum of the observed domestic receipts. For these energy commodities, a statistical difference arises that can not be attributed to a sector.\n\nThe breakdown into sectors follows mainly the classification as is customary in international energy statistics. This classification is based on functions of various sectors in the energy system and for several break downs on the international Standard Industrial Classification (SIC). There are two main sectors: the energy sector (companies with main activity indigenous production or transformation of energy) and energy consumers (other companies, vehicles and dwellings). In addition to a breakdown by sector, there is also a breakdown by energy commodity, such as coal, various petroleum products, natural gas, renewable energy, electricity and heat and other energy commodities like non renewable waste.\n\nThe definitions used in this table are exactly in line with the definitions in the Energy Balance table; supply, transformation and consumption. That table does not contain a breakdown by sector (excluding final energy consumption), but it does provide information about imports, exports and bunkering and also provides more detail about the energy commodities.\n\nData available:\nFrom: 1990.\n\nStatus of the figures:\nFigures up to and including 2022 are definite. Figures for 2023 are revised provisional. \n\nChanges as of November 15th 2024:\nThe structure of the table has been adjusted. The adjustment concerns the division into sectors, with the aluminum industry now being distinguished separately within the non-ferrous metal sector.\nThis table has also been revised for 2015 to 2021 as a result of new methods that have also been applied for 2022 and 2023. This concerns the following components: final energy consumption of LPG, distribution of final energy consumption of motor gasoline, sector classification of gas oil/diesel within the services and transfer of energy consumption of the nuclear industry from industry to the energy sector. The natural gas consumption of the wood and wood products industry has also been improved so that it is more comparable over time. This concerns changes of a maximum of a few PJ.\n\nChanges as of June 7th 2024:\nRevised provisional figures of 2023 have been added.\n\nChanges as of April 26th of 2024\nThe energy balance has been revised for 2015 and later on a limited number of points. The most important is the following:\n1. For solid biomass and municipal waste, the most recent data have been included. Furthermore data were affected by integration with figures for a new, yet to be published StatLine table on the supply of solid biomass. As a result, there are some changes in receipts of energy, deliveries of energy and indigenous production of biomass of a maximum of a few PJ.\n2. In the case of natural gas, an improvement has been made in the processing of data for stored LNG, which causes a shift between stock changes, receipts of energy and deliveries of energy of a maximum of a few PJ.\n\nChanges as of March 25th of 2024:\nThe energy balance has been revised and restructured. This concerns mainly the following:\n1. Different way of dealing with biofuels that have been mixed with fossil fuels\n2. A breakdown of the natural gas balance of agriculture into greenhouse horticulture and other agriculture.\n3. Final consumption of electricity in services \n\n1. Blended biofuels\nPreviously, biofuels mixed with fossil fuels were counted as petroleum crude and products. In the new energy balance, blended biofuels count for renewable energy and petroleum crude and products and the underlying products (such as gasoline, diesel and kerosene) only count the fossil part of mixtures of fossil and biogenic fuels. To make this clear, the names of the energy commodities have been changed. The consequence of this adjustment is that part of the energy has been moved from petroleum to renewable. The energy balance remains the same for total energy commodities. The aim of this adjustment is to make the increasing role of blended biofuels in the Energy Balance visible and to better align with the Energy Balances published by Eurostat and the International Energy Agency. Within renewable energy, biomass, liquid biomass is now a separate energy commodity. This concerns both pure and blended biofuels.\n\n2. Greenhouse horticulture separately\nThe energy consumption of agriculture in the Netherlands largely takes place in greenhouse horticulture. There is therefore a lot of attention for this sector and the need for separate data on energy consumption in greenhouse horticulture. To meet this need, the agriculture sector has been divided into two subsectors: Greenhouse horticulture and other agriculture. For the time being, we only publish separate natural gas figures for greenhouse horticulture.\n\n3. Higher final consumption of electricity in services in 2021 and 2022.\nThe way in which electric road transport is treated has improved, resulting in an increase in the supply and final consumption of electricity in services by more than 2 PJ in 2021 and 2022. This also works through the supply of electricity in sector H (Transport and storage).\n\nChanges as of November 14th 2023:\nFigures for 2021 and 2022 haven been adjusted.\nFigures for the Energy Balance for 2015 to 2020 have been revised regarding the following items:\n-\tFor 2109 and 2020 final consumption of heat in agriculture is a few PJ lower and for services a few PJ higher. This is the result of improved interpretation of available data in supply of heat to agriculture.\n-\tDuring the production of geothermal heat by agriculture natural gas is produced as by-product. Now this is included in the energy balance. The amount increased from 0,2 PJ in 2015 to 0,7 PJ in 2020.\n-\tThere are some improvements in the data for heat in industry with a magnitude of about 1 PJ or smaller.\n-\tThere some other improvements, also about 1 PJ or smaller.\n\nChanges as of June 15th 2023:\nRevised provisional figures of 2022 have been added.\n\nChanges as of December 15th 2022:\nFigures for 1990 up to and including 2019 have been revised. The revision mainly concerns the consumption of gas- and diesel oil and energy commodities higher in the classification (total petroleum products, total crude and petroleum produtcs and total energy commodities).\nThe revision is twofold:\n-\tNew data for the consumption of diesel oil in mobile machine have been incorporated. Consequently, the final energy consumption of gas- and diesel oil in construction, services and agriculture increases. The biggest change is in construction (+10 PJ from 1990-2015, decreasing to 1 PJ in 2019. In agriculture the change is about 0.5-1.5 PJ from 2010 onwards and for services the change is between 0 and 3 PJ for the whole period.\n-\tThe method for dealing with the statistical difference has been adapted. Earlier from 2013 onwards a difference of about 3 percent was assumed, matching old data (up to and including 2012) on final consumption of diesel for road transport based on the dedicated tax specifically for road that existed until 2012. In the new method the statistical difference is eliminated from 2015 onwards. Final consumption of road transport is calculated as the remainder of total supply to the market of diesel minus deliveries to users other than road transport.\nThe first and second item affect both final consumption of road transport that decreases consequently about 5 percent from 2015 onwards. Before the adaption of the tax system for gas- and diesel oil in 2013 the statistical difference was positive (more supply than consumption). With the new data for mobile machines total consumption has been increased and the statistical difference has been reduced and is even negative for a few years.\n\n\nChanges as of 1 March 2022:\nFigures for 1990 up to and including 2020 have been revised. The most important change is a different way of presenting own use of electricity of power-generating installations. Previously, this was regarded as electricity and CHP transformation input. From now on, this is seen as own use, as is customary in international energy statistics. As a result, the input and net energy transformation decrease and own use increases, on average about 15 PJ per year. Final consumers also have power generating installations. That's why final consumers now also have own use, previously this was not so. In the previous revision of 2021, the new sector blast furnaces was introduced for the years 2015 up to and including 2020, which describes the transformation of coke oven coke and coking coal into blast furnace gas that takes place in the production of pig iron from iron ore. This activity was previously part of the steel industry. With this revision, the change has been put back to 1990.\n\n\nWhen will new figures be published?\nRevised provisional figures: June/July of the following year.\nDefinite figures: December of the second following year.\n\n", "Summary": "Supply, consumption, energy transformation\nEnergy commodities, sector", "Modified": "2024-11-15T02:00:00", "MetaDataModified": "2024-11-15T02:00:00", "ReasonDelivery": "Redesign", "ExplanatoryText": "The structure of the table has been adjusted.

In energy statistics all these sources of energy are known as energy commodities. \n\nThe supply side of the balance sheet includes indigenous production of energy, net imports and exports and net stock changes.

The figures can be broken down by industry according to Statistics Netherlands' Standard Industrial Classification of all Economic Activities 2008 (SIC 2008). The change is shown both as a percentage change compared to a previous period and through index figures with 2021 as base year.\n\nTurnover and production changes are published in two forms. Firstly, as year-on-year changes where the growth is expressed relative to the same period in the previous year. These figures are presented unadjusted and calendar-adjusted. The second form represents period-on-period changes: month-on-month and quarter-on-quarter. Period-on-period changes are possible by applying seasonal adjustment.\n\nCurrently, this table exclusively comprises seasonally- and calendar adjusted data pertaining to monthly records for the retail sector. For other sectors, the unadjusted monthly series only extend back to January 2021, complicating the process of conducting adjustments. The lack of sufficient historical data makes it challenging to identify consistent patterns and trends, which is crucial for accurate adjustments. Some data may not be representative of all seasonal influences occurring over a longer period, potentially leading to less reliable or even incorrect adjustments. As the unadjusted monthly series lengthens, more reliable adjustments can be made. Therefore, in the spring of 2025, the table will be expanded to include seasonally- and calendar adjusted records for other sectors, retroactively from January 2021.\n\nData available from: January 2000 for branches within SIC division 47 and first quarter of 2005 for all other branches.\n\nStatus of figures:\nFigures for 2024 are provisional, other figures are final. \n\nThe figures of a calendar year become final no later than six months after the end of that calendar year. Due to delayed response, provisional figures may still change.\n\nChanges as of November 1, 2024:\nFigures of industries belonging to NACE sections G, H, I, J, L, M, N and S have been added. These are figures for the period September far as retail trade is concerned and August for other industries.\nFigures of the third quarter of 2024 may have been adjusted.\n\nTo keep the results of these index series in line with current events, a so-called base year change is carried out once every five years. In 2024, the publication of this table switched from reference year 2015 to 2021 (2021=100) and the weighting factors were updated and based on the year 2021. \n\nThis table combines data from 9 separate former tables. Which tables this concerns can be found later in this table explanation under \"3. Links to relevant tables and articles\".\n\nWhen are new figures released?\nFor monthly business statistics, figures are published as a rule 2 months after the end of the reporting month, figures for the retail trade sector and imports of new passenger cars and light commercial vehicles are published 1 month after the end of the reporting month. After publication of final results, Statistics Netherlands adjusts the figures only if major adjustments and/or corrections are necessary.\n\n", "Summary": "Trade and services; turnover and production changes, index 2021=100\nNaar bedrijfsactiviteit (SBI 2008) High Value Dataset \u2013 Statistiek", "Modified": "2024-11-01T02:00:00", "MetaDataModified": "2024-11-01T02:00:00", "ReasonDelivery": "Update", "ExplanatoryText": "", "OutputStatus": "Regular", "Source": "CBS.", "Language": "en", "Catalog": "CBS", "Frequency": "Monthly", "Period": "2000 - 2023, 2000Q1 - 2024Q3, jan 2000 - sep 2024", "SummaryAndLinks": "Trade and services; turnover and production changes, index 2021=100<br />Naar bedrijfsactiviteit (SBI 2008) High Value Dataset \u2013 Statistiek<br /><a href=\"http://opendata.cbs.nl/ODataApi/OData/85828ENG\">http://opendata.cbs.nl/ODataApi/OData/85828ENG</a><br /><a href=\"http://opendata.cbs.nl/ODataFeed/OData/85828ENG\">http://opendata.cbs.nl/ODataFeed/OData/85828ENG</a>", "ApiUrl": "https://opendata.cbs.nl/ODataApi/OData/85828ENG", "FeedUrl": "https://opendata.cbs.nl/ODataFeed/OData/85828ENG", "DefaultPresentation": "ts=1730291139306&graphtype=Table&r=Branches,Periods&k=Topics", "DefaultSelection": "$filter=((Branches eq '354300 ') or (Branches eq '356900 ') or (Branches eq '383100 ') or (Branches eq '389100 ') or (Branches eq '391600 ') or (Branches eq '410200 ') or (Branches eq 'B000657') or (Branches eq '403300 ') or (Branches eq 'B000655')) and ((Periods eq '2024MM01') or (Periods eq '2024MM02') or (Periods eq '2024MM03') or (Periods eq '2024KW01') or (Periods eq '2024MM04') or (Periods eq '2024MM05') or (Periods eq '2024MM06') or (Periods eq '2024KW02') or (Periods eq '2024MM07') or (Periods eq '2024MM08') or (Periods eq '2024MM09') or (Periods eq '2024KW03'))&$select=Branches, Periods, UncorrectedProductionTurnover_1, UncorrectedProductionTurnover_4, CalendarAdjustedProductionTurnover_5, CalendarAdjustedProductionTurnover_12, UncorrectedProductionTurnover_15, UncorrectedProductionTurnover_18", "GraphTypes": "Table,Bar,Line", "RecordCount": 45780, "ColumnCount": 23, "SearchPriority": "2"}, {"Updated": "2024-01-29T02:00:00", "ID": 4829, "Identifier": "83616ENG", "Title": "Key figures municipal budgets; levies by region and size class", "ShortTitle": "Key figures municipal budgets; levies", "ShortDescription": "\nThis table concerns the budgeted revenues of part of the municipal revenues in millions of euros and in euros per inhabitant.

Through these lump sum payments the loans are repaid, causing the loans to decrease by an equal amount in 1995.\n2008 - As of January 2008 deferred payments  received from European and Dutch governments for a specific purpose (such as the construction of new infrastructure) to cover expenses in previous years, are recorded in the balance sheet differently.

Since the received book profit and super dividends are considered part of the current account, the increase is visible there.\n2015 - Due to the transfer of tasks in the area of social support from General Government to municipalities, the revenues and expenses have increased by approximately 7 billion euros.

The figures have been collected from previously published tables on provincial finances and have been based on annual realisation figures. The data presented were taken from the annual accounts and the balance sheets of the respective provinces, and match as closely as possible the definitions and classifications used by the provinces themselves in their administration.\n\nImportant events:\n2008 -  As of January 2008, transfers received in advance from European and Dutch governments with a specific spending purpose (. e.g. the construction of new infrastructure) to cover expenses in future years are included in the balance sheet in a different way. From that year onward, these received transfers are included under deferred liabilities. The received transfers were previously booked under the provisions.\nThis led to a break in the figures of the relevant balance sheet items from 2007 to 2008.\n2009 \u2013 Provinces sold their shares in the energy companies Essent and NUON. The result of this transaction was nearly 13 billion euros in revenue.\n2013 - Mandatory Treasury Banking was established by the government. From the end of 2013 onwards, all public authorities must hold their surplus assets with central government (Treasury Banking Act). As an alternative to keeping surplus funds in the treasury, local governments may opt for using these funds to provide loans to each other.\n2014 \u2013 Provinces sold their share in waste processing company Attero.\n2015 - All youth care tasks were transferred from the provinces to the municipalities. In addition in 2015, the task of regional accessibility around large cities (with the exception of Amsterdam and Rotterdam) was transferred from the plus regions (local intergovernmental organisations) to the provinces. On balance, these two changes led to lower revenues and lower expenses for the provinces.\n2016 - The balance of accounts of expenditure and revenue was almost 700 million euros positive in 2016. This positive balance of accounts is partly due to a change in the system for the Provincial Fund. As of 2016, the target payment (BDU) towards traffic and transport became part of the Provincial Fund. With this change, all central government grants received must be accounted for as fair value and not just the part for which expenses are also accounted for (according to BBV regulations).\n2017 - In 2017, the regulations concerning the BBV were renewed. As a result of this renewal, the template  for the Information for Third Parties (Iv3) was changed. With regard to this table, this renewal has not led to a break in the series.\n\nStatus of the figures:\nThe figures in this table are provisional at the time of first publication.

Alternatively, tables selections can be made that show break down by economic activity (including households), by water type and annual use. Values are shown in million cubic meters of water (mln m3).\n \nWith tap water, a distinction is made between tap water of drinking water quality and industrial water. Industrial water is tap water with a less quality than drinking water, or sometimes with a better quality, like demineralized water. This industrial water is mainly used by the industry and electricity producers.  For surface water a distinction is made between fresh surface water and seawater. Within all water types (except drinking water) a distinction is made between use for cooling and use for other purposes. The data are derived from a diverse set of sources, more about those sources can be found in chapter 4. \n\nData in the environmental accounts directly correspond to the economic data in the national accounts, that allows assessment of the impact of the economic activities of the Netherlands for the use of water taken from the natural environment in quantitative terms.

The table also includes the derived consumer price index: this price index excludes the effect of changes in the rates of product-related taxes (e.g. VAT and excise duty on alcohol and tobacco) and subsidies and consumption-related taxes (e.g. motor vehicle tax).\n\nThe table also includes the month-on-month and year-on-year changes of the CPI. Annual rate of change can be defined as the year-on-year change of total consumer expenditure. These figures are shown for 337 product groups. Furthermore, 34 combinations of product groups (special aggregates) are displayed in the table. The weighting coefficient shows how much Dutch consumers spend on each product group in relation to their total expenditure. The total weighting is 100,000.\n\nCPI figures are published every month. In addition, an annual figure is published at the end of the year. The CPI of a calendar year is calculated as the average of the indices of the twelve months of that year.\n\nData available from: January 1996.\n\nStatus of the figures:\nFigures of the flash estimate are published at the end of a reporting month, or shortly thereafter. At the flash estimate, annual rates of change and monthly rates of change are made available for the all items category and for a selection of special aggregates. These figures are calculated on the basis of still incomplete source data. These figures are not suitable for indexation purposes. Therefore, the publication of the flash estimate does not include indices. The rates of change of the flash estimate are characterized as provisional. \n\nThe flash estimate is followed by the first publication of all indices and rates of change for the reporting month. These figures are also provisional. The figures for that same reporting month become final one month later. Differences between the provisional and final indices are caused by source material that has become available after the provisional publication.\n\nChanges compared with previous version:\nData on the most recent period have been added and/or adjustments have been implemented.\n\nChanges as of 8 February 2024:\nStarting in the reporting month of January 2024, a price change will be published for expenditure category 063000 Hospital Services. The baseline month for this new index series is December 2023. This means that the index level of 100 is the price level measured in December 2023. Previously, between 2006 and 2009, an index was published for the same expenditure category. The baseline year for that index series was 2006=100. It was discontinued after December 2009. The current series starts again from 100 in December 2023.\n\nChanges as of 1 June 2016:\nFor all series new data is added for the period 1996 to January 2015.\nTo complete the data, the existing series that were terminated before 2015 are added to the table.\n\nThis concerns the series:\n2006=100:\n011320 Frozen fish\n031100 Clothing materials\n031420 Repair and hire of clothing\n032200 Repair and hire of footwear\n043210 Services of plumbers\n043230 Maintenance of heating systems\n043250 Services of carpenters\n043290 Oth. maint. services for dwell.\n051300 Repair of furniture etc.\n053190 Other major household appliances\n063000 Services of hospitals\n091420 Unrecorded recording media\n094240 Hire of equipment for culture\n096010 Package domestic holidays\n2000=100:\n134000 Real estate tax\n\nThese series do not have base year 2015=100. 2006=100 and 2000=100 are added for these series. When another base year applies, it is mentioned explicitly in the description.\n\nWhen will new figures be published?\nThe figures of the flash estimate are published on the last working day of the month to which the figures relate, or shortly thereafter. \n\nThe new indices are usually published between the first and second Thursday of the month following on the reporting month.

To ensure that the results of the index series are more in line with current events, a so-called base shift is implemented once every five years. Due to the implementation of FRIBS (Framework Regulation Integrating Business Statistics) in 2021, this time the base shift is postponed by one year to 2021=100. The subsequent base shift will return to a regular year, namely 2025=100. Upon the publication of the reporting period of the 1st quarter of 2024, such a base shift will occur, and the reference year will be switched to 2021 (2021=100). The index series with the reference 2021=100 will be published in new StatLine tables. This table will be discontinued from that moment and will no longer be updated.

output indices 2000=100\". From the 2nd quarter 2009 on, the figures of the series 2005 = 100 are used and linked to the series 2000 = 100. \nStatistics Netherlands publishes data on the value of construction output. The volume of construction output, however, cannot be deduced from the value, which is subject to price changes. The price index on the building costs of new dwellings eliminates the effect of price changes.\nThe price index on construction output is calculated by distributing the value of the output (current prices) over the quarters essential to the price setting of the building project. Subsequently, the quarterly output is calculated in fixed prices by using the price index on the building costs of new dwellings. The index figure of the output price is the sum of the current prices divided by the sum of the fixed prices (*100).\n\nPossibilities for selection: \n- Total construction\n- Total construction of new dwellings/buildings\n- New dwellings\n- New buildings in the private sector\n- New buildings in the non-commercial sector\n- Total other buildings\n- Other dwellings\n- Other buildings in the private sector\n- Other buildings in the non-commercial sector\n\nData available from 1st quarter 2000 till 4th quarter 2016\nFrequency: discontinued\n\nStatus of the figures: \nThe figures of 2016 are provisional.

See paragraph 3. \n\nLinking recommendation\nIf you want to compile long-term series with linked price indices on production of buildings, you can link the figures on price level 1995 with the figures on price level 2000. For that, the percentage change from the 2nd quarter 2005 with the 1st quarter 2005 must be calculated, as the price index for the 1st quarter 2005 is the last figure published on price level 1995. This change must then be adjusted to the figures for the 1st quarter 2005 of the series 1995.\nThe 2nd quarter index of the linked series is calculated by calculating the difference between the 1st quarter 2005 and the 2nd quarter 2005 according to the series on price level 2000 and multiplying this by the index for the 1st quarter 2005 according to the series on price level 1995.\n \nIn the example: (119/120) x 148=147 (rounded). For the 3rd quarter 2005 the index is calculated analogously, where because of rounding problems the first quarter figures must be used for the link.\n\n", "Summary": "Production indices on total output Price construction, new construction \nof houses, private sector and non-commercial sector.", "Modified": "2017-01-27T02:00:00", "MetaDataModified": "2018-01-29T02:00:00", "ReasonDelivery": "Discontinued", "ExplanatoryText": "", "OutputStatus": "Discontinued", "Source": "CBS.", "Language": "en", "Catalog": "CBS", "Frequency": "Discontinued", "Period": "2000 first quarter - 2016 fourth quarter", "SummaryAndLinks": "Production indices on total output Price construction, new construction <br />of houses, private sector and non-commercial sector.<br /><a href=\"http://opendata.cbs.nl/ODataApi/OData/70979eng\">http://opendata.cbs.nl/ODataApi/OData/70979eng</a><br /><a href=\"http://opendata.cbs.nl/ODataFeed/OData/70979eng\">http://opendata.cbs.nl/ODataFeed/OData/70979eng</a>", "ApiUrl": "https://opendata.cbs.nl/ODataApi/OData/70979eng", "FeedUrl": "https://opendata.cbs.nl/ODataFeed/OData/70979eng", "DefaultPresentation": "graphType=table", "DefaultSelection": "$filter=((Periods eq '2000JJ00') or (Periods eq '2005JJ00') or (Periods eq '2010JJ00') or (Periods eq '2011JJ00') or (Periods eq '2012JJ00') or (Periods eq '2013JJ00') or (Periods eq '2014JJ00') or (Periods eq '2015KW01') or (Periods eq '2015KW02') or (Periods eq '2015KW03') or (Periods eq '2015KW04') or (Periods eq '2015JJ00') or (Periods eq '2016KW01') or (Periods eq '2016KW02') or (Periods eq '2016KW03') or (Periods eq '2016KW04') or (Periods eq '2016JJ00'))&$select=Periods, TotalConstruction_1, TotalConstOfNewDwellingsBuildings_2, Dwellings_3, PrivateSector_4, NonCommercialSector_5, TotalOtherBuildings_6, Dwellings_7, PrivateSector_8, NonCommercialSector_9&k=Topics&r=Periods", "GraphTypes": "Table,Bar,Line", "RecordCount": 85, "ColumnCount": 10, "SearchPriority": "1"}, {"Updated": "2005-08-10T11:43:00", "ID": 5171, "Identifier": "60011ENG", "Title": "Price index figures on the production of buildings, excluding VAT", "ShortTitle": "Price indices buildings; 1995-2004", "ShortDescription": "Production indices on total output Price construction, new construction\nof dwellings, private sector and non-commercial sector\n1995 - 2004, 1st quarter 1995 - 1st quarter 2005\nChanged on August 10 2005.\nFrequency: Discontinued.", "Summary": "Production indices on total output Price construction, new construction\nof dwellings, private sector and non-commercial sector", "Modified": "2005-08-10T11:43:00", "MetaDataModified": "2005-08-10T11:43:00", "ReasonDelivery": "Discontinued", "ExplanatoryText": "", "OutputStatus": "Discontinued", "Source": "CBS.", "Language": "en", "Catalog": "CBS", "Frequency": "Discontinued", "Period": "1995 - 2004, 1st quarter 1995 - 1st quarter 2005", "SummaryAndLinks": "Production indices on total output Price construction, new construction<br />of dwellings, private sector and non-commercial sector<br /><a href=\"http://opendata.cbs.nl/ODataApi/OData/60011ENG\">http://opendata.cbs.nl/ODataApi/OData/60011ENG</a><br /><a href=\"http://opendata.cbs.nl/ODataFeed/OData/60011ENG\">http://opendata.cbs.nl/ODataFeed/OData/60011ENG</a>", "ApiUrl": "https://opendata.cbs.nl/ODataApi/OData/60011ENG", "FeedUrl": "https://opendata.cbs.nl/ODataFeed/OData/60011ENG", "DefaultPresentation": "graphType=table", "DefaultSelection": "", "GraphTypes": "Table,Bar,Line", "RecordCount": 51, "ColumnCount": 10, "SearchPriority": "1"}, {"Updated": "2014-01-09T02:00:00", "ID": 5172, "Identifier": "37263eng", "Title": "Changes in the dwelling stock; 1995-2011", "ShortTitle": "Changes in the dwelling stock; 1995-2011", "ShortDescription": "\nThe statistics on changes in the dwelling stock provide information on the increase, decrease at the beginning and at the end of each quarter and year, broken down by type of ownership.\n\nData published by provinces, COROP-regions, urban regions, metropolitan agglomerations and municipalities.

Energy is released - among other things - during the combustion of for example natural gas, petroleum, hard coal and biofuels. Energy can also be obtained from electricity or heat, or extracted from natural resources, e.g. wind or solar energy. In energy statistics all these sources of energy are known as energy commodities. \n\nThe supply side of the balance sheet includes indigenous production of energy, net imports and exports and net stock changes. This is mentioned primary energy supply, because this is the amount of energy available for transformation or consumption in the country.\n\nFor energy transformation, the table gives figures on the transformation input (amount of energy used to make other energy commodities), the transformation output (amount of energy made from other energy commodities) and net energy transformation. The latter is the amount of energy lost during the transformation of energy commodities. \n\nThen the energy balance sheet shows the final consumption of energy. This is the energy consumers utilize for energy purposes. The last form of energy use is non-energy use. This is the use of an energy commodity for a product that is not energy. \n\nData available:\nFrom 1946 (annual) and from 1995 up to and including 2016 (annual and quarterly).\n\nStatus of the figures:\nAll figures up to 2014 are definite.

These are related to improved convergence with international conventions.\n1.\tShifting of the electricity supply to the sector electricity and gas supply. Up to and including 2015, the electricity supplied to the sector electricity and gas supply was included as electricity and CHP transformation input for production of electricity. As of 2016, this electricity supply is included in energy sector own use. This amounted to approximately 2 PJ for 2016.\n2.\tShifting of input of blast furnace gas and coke oven gas to coke-oven plants.\nCokes-oven plants use blast furnace gas and coke oven gas to produce process heat. Up to and including 2015, these were included in other transformation input. As of 2016, these are included in coke-oven plants own use. These amounted to approximately 8 PJ in coal gas for 2016. \n\nChanges as of 12 October 2016:\nFigures of 1990-1994 have been revised.\n\nThe data of the energy balance sheet for the period 1990 up to and including 1994 have been revised. This revision is a follow up of the revision of last year for the reporting years 1995 up to and including 2013. The most important reasons for the this revision were a break in the time series for the non-energy use, the possibility to use data of the client files of the grid operators for determination of the final consumption of natural gas and electricity and the availability of new information on the use fuels for transport and mobile machines. Furthermore own use of energy companies is now reported separately and not included any more in final consumption.

Lastly the benefits are classified by the sector providing the benefit.\n\nIn line with the regulations in the European System of Accounts (ESA95), benefits are recorded when they are claimed (accrual-based recording), not when they are paid (cash-based recording).\n\nData available from 1994 to 2012.\n\nStatus of the figures:\nThe figures in this table are definite up to 2010, revised provisional for 2011 and provisional for 2012. Because this table is discontinued, figures will not be updated anymore.\n\nChanges as of 10 April 2015.\nNone, this table is discontinued.\n\nWhen will new figures be published?\nNot applicable anymore.\n", "Summary": "Social protection benefits. \nFunctions, criteria and execution.", "Modified": "2013-09-23T02:00:00", "MetaDataModified": "2015-04-10T02:00:00", "ReasonDelivery": "Discontinued", "ExplanatoryText": "", "OutputStatus": "Discontinued", "Source": "CBS.", "Language": "en", "Catalog": "CBS", "Frequency": "Discontinued", "Period": "1994 - 2012", "SummaryAndLinks": "Social protection benefits. <br />Functions, criteria and execution.<br /><a href=\"http://opendata.cbs.nl/ODataApi/OData/80106eng\">http://opendata.cbs.nl/ODataApi/OData/80106eng</a><br /><a href=\"http://opendata.cbs.nl/ODataFeed/OData/80106eng\">http://opendata.cbs.nl/ODataFeed/OData/80106eng</a>", "ApiUrl": "https://opendata.cbs.nl/ODataApi/OData/80106eng", "FeedUrl": "https://opendata.cbs.nl/ODataFeed/OData/80106eng", "DefaultPresentation": "graphType=table", "DefaultSelection": "$filter=((Periods eq '1995JJ00') or (Periods eq '2000JJ00') or (Periods eq '2005JJ00') or (Periods eq '2008JJ00') or (Periods eq '2009JJ00') or (Periods eq '2010JJ00') or (Periods eq '2011JJ00') or (Periods eq '2012JJ00'))&$select=Periods, TotalSocialProtectionBenefits_1, SicknessHealthCare_2, Disability_3, OldAge_4, Survivors_5, Family_6, Unemployment_7, Housing_8, Education_9, SocialExclusionNotMentionedAbove_10, GovernmentControlledSchemes_11, NonGovernmentControlledSchemes_12, CompulsorySchemes_13, NonCompulsorySchemes_14, ContributorySchemes_15, NonContributorySchemes_16, UniversalSchemes_17, GeneralSchemes_18, SpecialSchemes_19, BasicSchemes_20, SupplementarySchemes_21, DirectlyThroughEmployers_22, PensionFundsInsuranceCompanies_23, SocBenefitsIndNonMarketProducers_24, SectorGovernment_25&k=Periods&r=Topics", "GraphTypes": "Table,Bar,Line", "RecordCount": 19, "ColumnCount": 26, "SearchPriority": "1"}, {"Updated": "2012-01-03T02:00:00", "ID": 5304, "Identifier": "60012eng", "Title": "The State; government sector, ESA accounts 1996-2010", "ShortTitle": "The State; government sector 1996-2010", "ShortDescription": "\nAs part of the statistics on government finances, Statistics Netherlands \n(CBS) collects data on the size, composition and allocation of the \nexpenditures and revenues and the balance sheet position of the State. \n\nThe State includes ministries, budget funds and agencies.

Firstly for the Dutch definition a threshold value of twelve hours is used for the number of hours a person wants to work in a week. For the international definition this is not the case. Secondly the unemployed population is defined differently. \nAccording to the international definition someone must be able to start working within two weeks. For the Dutch definition in some cases a term of three months is used when someone can start working or actively search for work.\n\nData available from 2000 to2013.\n\nStatus of the figures: \nThe figures in this table are definite.\n\nChanges as of 26 February 2015:\nNone, this table was stopped.\n\nChanges as of 1 April 2014:\nThe figures on 2013 were added to this table.

The Royal Library (Koninklijke Bibliotheek) provides the service of the online Library to the registered members of Dutch public libraries and of the Dutch online public library.\n\nFirst of all: the table describes the extent to which registered users make use of the different digital products that are being offered by the online library. Secondly, the tables provides insight into how the number of online Library users has evolved as of the year 2015, specifically in terms of age (youth/adult) and type (public library members/Digital Only users). The table also includes information on the number of active and non-active users of the digital library products, how many new accounts have been added and how many have expired. Finally, the table presents information about the number of licences the online Library has in its digital collection. Most of these concern e-books, but the table also contains the number of licences needed to access other digital products (e.g. courses and audio books). Where possible: these figures are specified by target group and genre.\n\nAs of the year 2016, the section \u2018use\u2019 includes information about courses for the first time. In the \"accounts\" section, in 2016 a distinction was made between different types of membership of the digital library. In addition, since 2016, both active and non-active accounts have been specified by the age of users. In 2017, for the first time figures have been included with regard to new and expired accounts. In the \u2018licenses\u2019 section, in 2016 figures were added with regard to audio books and courses. As from 2017, these figures have been specified into more detail: the licenses for the courses are specified by age, the licenses for audio books by age and genre. The latter also applies to the licenses for the VakantieBieb.\n\nAs of the year 2019, the online public library no longer offers online courses. Figures about downloads, accounts and licenses regarding online courses are no longer available. Neither are figures regarding new and terminated digital only memberships.\n\nAs from 2020, the KB started using a new registration system, in which the information on accounts is registered in a different way than before. Also, since 2020 a single digital account can be used for lending e-books as well as for downloading audio books (before 2020, two different accounts were needed for these actions). Besides that, new applications (like ThuisBieb) have been used in 2020 for offering digital products. Due to these changes, the figures regarding digital accounts in 2020 are not comparable to the figures presented in previous years. Therefore, the StatLine table has not been updated with the preliminary figures for 2020. Instead, a customized table with information on the Dutch online library has been placed on the CBS website (Dutch only).

These data are based on the territory principle, however, everything that happens within the Dutch territory.

The capital stock of different branches and sectors is presented here. The capital stock is broken down by type of capital good.\n\nFigures of the sectors households and non-profit institutions serving households (NPISH) are from reporting year 2013 onwards no longer separately published. Only their aggregate will be published. The reason for this change is that reliable estimates for NPISH for recent years are no longer available.\n\nData available from: 1995\nStatus of the figures:\nThe figures for the most recent reporting year 2016 are provisional. The status of the figures for 2015 is final. \n\nChanges as of February 2018\nNone, this table has been replaced by an updated version. See paragraph 3.\n\nChanges as from 13 July 2017:\nProvisional figures on the reporting year 2016 have been added.\nUsing old data has led to incorrect figures for investments of the households and NPISHs for the reporting years 2001-2010. Adjusting for these errors results in different figures on investments and the statistical discrepancies. Smaller differences due to rounding occur for the capital stock opening and closing balance sheet, the depreciation and the revaluation.\nData on the years 1995-2000 have been added.\n\nChanges as from 25 October 2016:\nA number of corrections have been applied as a result of mistakes in the calculations for the years 2002, 2003, 2004, 2009 and 2015. These mistakes did not result in any changes in the totals for the closing balance sheet, but led to incorrect aggregations of sectors/branches or type of capital good. \n\nFurthermore the calculation method of the volume indices have been harmonised for the capital stock and non-financial balance sheets.  Moreover, the volume index will now be calculated on the basis of rounded figures. Because of these changes in method a maximum difference of 109.5 percent points occurs for series of less than 100 mln. A maximum difference of 2.1 percent points occurs for series larger than 100 mln. Volume indices of series which contain 0 mln of capital stock every year are set at 100, rather than hidden.\n\nWhen will new figures be published?\nProvisional data are published 6 months after the end of the reporting year. Final data are released 18 months after the end of the reporting year.\nSince the end of June 2016 the release and revision policy of the national accounts have been changed.

Disaggregated data and labour productivity are also published in this table. \nThis table is based on the current classification of branches (SIC 2008). The figures in this table are based on the National Accounts, which have been compiled in accordance with ESA 2010.\n\nData available from: 1995\n\nStatus of the figures:\nData from 1995 up to and including 2014 are final. Data of 2015 and 2016 are provisional. Since this table has been discontinued, data of 2015 and 2016 will not become final.\n\nChanges as of 15 June 2018:\nFigures of 1995-2000 and 2016 have been added. Data of 2014 and 2015 have been revised. As a result of the addition of the reporting year 2000 it was possible to calculate the annual changes for the year 2001. Previously they were indicated with a dot (.), but now the percentual change is displayed.\n\nChanges as of 24 July 2018:\nFor the reporting year 2016 the indices with base year 2010 have been calculated incorrectly. They were not congruent with the annual percentage changes. This has been corrected. The difference with the previous version of this table varies between +2.5 points and -3.2 points.\n\nChanges as of May 24th 2019:\nNone. This table has been discontinued.\nStatistics Netherlands has carried out a revision of the national accounts. New statistical sources and estimation methods have been used during the revision. Therefore this table has been replaced by table Approaches of domestic product (GDP); National Accounts.

This results in adjustments in production index and other short term statistics. The adaptation of the turnover definition is related to a change in registration of enterprises that (partially) contract out their production abroad.\nThe adjustment means that goods dealt with by foreign subsidiaries of Dutch parent companies do count for Dutch production. Goods dealt with in the Netherlands by Dutch subsidiaries of foreign parent companies that remain property of these parent companies do no longer count as Dutch production. \nHowever, they count as export of services for the sum that has been added to value in the Netherlands.\nUntil December 2009, index figures for manufacturing turnover are based on the previous turnover definition. From January 2010 onwards, the turnover figures are based on the new turnover definition.
