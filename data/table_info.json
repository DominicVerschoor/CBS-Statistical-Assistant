{"Identifier":"00372eng","TitleTable":"Natural gas balance sheet; supply and consumption","Summary":"Indigenous production, imports, exports, stock change and consumption \n ","Period":"1946 - November 2024","ShortDescription":"\nThis table shows the supply and the consumption of natural gas as a balance sheet. The supply of natural gas is calculated as the sum of indigenous production, production from other sources, imports minus exports, minus delivery of fuels for international shipping (bunkers) plus stock changes. The supply is equal to the amount of natural gas used in the Netherlands in the same period.\n\nThis consumption is broken down by how it's delivered by the gas distribution network. This consists of a main grid and connected regional grids. Large-scale consumers, like power plants and large companies, receive the gas directly from the main distribution network. Small-scale consumers, including households, receive their natural gas through the regional grids. Then a small amount of natural gas is used in the indigenous production and transportation of natural gas. Lastly, there is flared and vented natural gas.\n\nData available:\nFrom 1946 annually and from 1982 annually, quarterly and monthly.\n\nStatus of the figures:\n - up to and including 2022 definite.\n - 2023 is revised provisional.\n - 2024 is provisional.\n\nChanges as of December 13th 2024:\nFigures for November 2024 have been added.\n\nChanges as of November 29th 2024:\nFigures of October 2024 have been updated.\n\nChanges as of November 15th 2024:\nFigures for October 2024 have been added.

Data collection for the agricultural census is part of a combined data collection for a.o. agricultural policy use and enforcement of the manure law.\n\nRegional breakdown is based on the main location of the holding. Due to this the region where activities (crops, animals) are allocated may differ from the location where these activities actually occur.\n\nThe agricultural census is also used as the basis for the European Farm Structure Survey (FSS). Data from the agricultural census do not fully coincide with the FSS. In the FSS years (2000, 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2010)  additional information was collected to meet the requirements of the FSS.\n\nReference date for livestock is 1 April and for crops 15 May.\n\nIn 2022, equidae are not part of the Agricultural Census. This affects the farm type and the total number of farms in the Agricultural Census. Farms with horses, ponies and donkeys that were previously classified as \u2018specialist grazing livestock' could be classified, according to their dominant activity, as another farm type in 2022.\n\nFrom 2020 onwards, the SO2017, based on the years 2015 to 2019, will apply (see also the explanation for SO: Standard Output).\n\nFrom 2018 onwards the number of calves for fattening, pigs for fattening, chicken and turkey are adjusted in the case of temporary breaks in the production cycle (e.g. sanitary cleaning).\nThe agricultural census is a structural survey, in which adjustment for temporary breaks in the production cycle is a.o. relevant for the calculation of the economic size of the holding, and its farm type.\nIn the livestock surveys the number of animals on the reference day is relevant, therefore no adjustment for temporary breaks in the production cycle are made.\nThis means that the number of animals in the tables of the agricultural census may differ from those in the livestock tables (see \u2018links to relevant tables and relevant articles).\n\nFrom 2017 onwards, animal numbers are increasingly derived from I&R registers (Identification and Registration of animals), instead of by means of the combined data collection. The I&R registers are the responsibility of RVO (Netherlands Enterprise Agency). Since 2017, cattle numbers are derived from I&R cattle, and from 2018 sheep, goats and poultry are also derived from the relevant I&R registers. The registration of cattle, sheep and goats takes place directly at RVO. Poultry data is collected via the designated database Poultry Information System Poultry (KIP) from Avined. Avined is a branch organization for the egg and poultry meat sectors. Avined passes the data on to the central database of RVO. Due to the transition to the use of I&R registers, a change in classification will occur for sheep and goats from 2018 onwards.\n\nSince 2016, information of the Dutch Business Register is used  to define the agricultural census. Registration in the Business Register with an agricultural standard industrial classification code (SIC), related to NACE\/ISIC, (in Dutch SBI: \u2018Standaard BedrijfsIndeling\u2019) is leading to determine whether there is an agricultural holding. This aligns the agricultural census  as closely as possible to the statistical regulations of Eurostat and the (Dutch) implementation of the definition of 'active farmer' as described in the common agricultural policy.\n\nThe  definition of the agricultural census based on information from the Dutch Business Register mainly affects the number of holdings, a clear deviation of the trend occurs. The impact on areas (except for other land and rough grazing) and the number of animals (except for sheep, horses and ponies) is limited. This is mainly due  to the holdings that are excluded as a result of the new delimitation of  agricultural holdings (such as equestrian centres, city farms and organisations in nature management).\n\nIn 2011 there were changes in geographic assignment of holdings with a foreign main seat. This may influence regional figures, mainly in border regions.\n\nUntil 2010 the economic size of agricultural holdings was expressed in Dutch size units (in Dutch NGE: 'Nederlandse Grootte Eenheid').

The most important legal tasks are flood defense, water management (ensuring the right water level for agriculture, nature, residents) and ensuring water quality. Some water boards also manage roads and waterways.\nThe water boards impose water system levies, road levies and non-task-related levies (till 2015) on four categories of taxpayers: residents, owners of buildings, owners of land (unbuilt) and owners of nature sites. A water board can choose to impose a separate road levy or to pay the costs of road management and maintenance from the water system levy.\nWater boards can apply tariff differentiation. This means that a water board can use different tariffs for the same levy for, for example, areas outside dikes and inside dikes. If this is the case, the table shows an average rate.

Results of the latter question are inverted when calculating the producer confidence, since a surplus of finished products is seen as something negative. \n\nThe more optimistic or pessimistic manufacturing companies are, the more positive or negative the value of the producer confidence indicator is compared with the zero line, and the greater the expectation that manufacturing production in the coming months will increase or decrease respectively. The producer confidence indicator has been available since 1985. For the sectors of manufacturing industry given in this table, the results are available from the start of 1994.\nThis publication is created using co-financing by the European Commission.\n\nData available from: January 1985\n\nStatus of the figures:\nThe figures are definitive.\n\nChanges as of November 28th 2024:\nFigures of November 2024 have been added.\n\nWhen will new figures be published?\nFigures of December are expected to be published the 6th of January 2025.\n\n","TitleColumn":"Sector\/branches (SIC 2008) | Margins | Seasonal adjustment | Periods | Producer confidence | Producer confidence indicator components | Expected activity | Opinion on order books | Stocks of finished products"}

The data presented were taken from the annual accounts and the balance sheets of the respective provinces, and match as closely as possible the definitions and classifications used by the provinces themselves in their administration.\n\nImportant events:\n2008 -  As of January 2008, transfers received in advance from European and Dutch governments with a specific spending purpose (. e.g. the construction of new infrastructure) to cover expenses in future years are included in the balance sheet in a different way. From that year onward, these received transfers are included under deferred liabilities. The received transfers were previously booked under the provisions.\nThis led to a break in the figures of the relevant balance sheet items from 2007 to 2008.\n2009 \u2013 Provinces sold their shares in the energy companies Essent and NUON. The result of this transaction was nearly 13 billion euros in revenue.\n2013 - Mandatory Treasury Banking was established by the government. From the end of 2013 onwards, all public authorities must hold their surplus assets with central government (Treasury Banking Act). As an alternative to keeping surplus funds in the treasury, local governments may opt for using these funds to provide loans to each other.\n2014 \u2013 Provinces sold their share in waste processing company Attero.\n2015 - All youth care tasks were transferred from the provinces to the municipalities. In addition in 2015, the task of regional accessibility around large cities (with the exception of Amsterdam and Rotterdam) was transferred from the plus regions (local intergovernmental organisations) to the provinces. On balance, these two changes led to lower revenues and lower expenses for the provinces.\n2016 - The balance of accounts of expenditure and revenue was almost 700 million euros positive in 2016. This positive balance of accounts is partly due to a change in the system for the Provincial Fund. As of 2016, the target payment (BDU) towards traffic and transport became part of the Provincial Fund. With this change, all central government grants received must be accounted for as fair value and not just the part for which expenses are also accounted for (according to BBV regulations).\n2017 - In 2017, the regulations concerning the BBV were renewed. As a result of this renewal, the template  for the Information for Third Parties (Iv3) was changed.

{"Identifier":"83140ENG","TitleTable":"Energy balance sheet; supply, transformation and consumption","Summary":"Energy, supply, transformation, consumption, final consumption\nNatural gas, electricity, petroleum, hard coal, renewable energy, heat","Period":"1946-2023","ShortDescription":"\nThis table shows the supply, transformation and the consumption of energy in a balance sheet. Energy is released - among other things - during the combustion of for example natural gas, petroleum, hard coal and biofuels. Energy can also be obtained from electricity or heat, or extracted from natural resources, e.g. wind or solar energy. In energy statistics all these sources of energy are known as energy commodities. \n\nThe supply side of the balance sheet includes indigenous production of energy, net imports and exports and net stock changes. This is mentioned primary energy supply, because this is the amount of energy available for transformation or consumption in the country.\n\nFor energy transformation, the table gives figures on the transformation input (amount of energy used to make other energy commodities), the transformation output (amount of energy made from other energy commodities) and net energy transformation. The latter is the amount of energy lost during the transformation of energy commodities. \n\nThen the energy balance sheet shows the final consumption of energy. First, it refers to the own use and distribution losses. After deduction of these amounts remains the final consumption of energy customers. This comprises the final energy consumption and non-energy use. The final energy consumption is the energy consumers utilize for energy purposes. It is specified for successively industry, transport and other customers, broken down into various sub-sectors. The last form of energy is the non-energy use. This is the use of an energy commodity for a product that is not energy.\n\nData available:\nFrom 1946.\n\nStatus of the figures:\nAll figures up to and including 2022 are definite. Figures for 2023 are revised provisional.\n\nChanges as of November 15th 2024:\nThe structure of the table has been adjusted. This concerns the classification into energy commodities, section 'other energy commodities'. The new classification ensures that it is now exactly in line with the classification used by Eurostat when publishing the Energy Balance Sheet. \nThis table has also been revised for 2015 to 2021 as a result of new methods that have also been applied for 2022 and 2023. This concerns the following components: final energy consumption of LPG, distribution of final energy consumption of motor gasoline and transfer of energy consumption of the nuclear industry from industry to the energy sector. The natural gas consumption of the wood and wood products industry has also been improved so that it is more comparable over time. This concerns changes of a maximum of a few PJ.\n\nChanges as of June 7th 2024:\nRevised provisional figures of 2023 have been added.\n\nChanges as of April 26th 2024:\n\n- Provisional figures of 2023 have been added.\n\nThe energy balance has been revised for 2015 and later on a limited number of points. The most important is the following:\n1. For solid biomass and municipal waste, the most recent data have been included. Furthermore data were affected by integration with figures for a new, yet to be published StatLine table on the supply of solid biomass. As a result, there are some changes in imports, exports and indigenous production of biomass of a maximum of a few PJ.\n2. In the case of natural gas, an improvement has been made in the processing of data for stored LNG, which causes a shift between stock changes, imports and exports of a maximum of a few PJ.\n3. Data for final energy consumption of blended biofuels per subsector in transport were incorrectly excluded. These have now been made visible.\n\nChanges as of March 25th 2024:\nThe energy balance has been revised and restructured. It concerns mainly a different way of dealing with biofuels that are mixed with fossil fuels.\n\nPreviously, biofuels mixed with fossil fuels were counted as petroleum crude and products. In the new energy balance, blended biofuels count for renewable energy and petroleum crude and products and the underlying products (such as gasoline, diesel and kerosene) only count the fossil part of mixtures of fossil and biogenic fuels. To make this clear, the names of the energy commodities have been adjusted. The consequence of this adjustment is that part of the energy has been moved from petroleum to renewable. The energy balance remains the same for total energy commodities. The aim of this adjustment is to make the increasing role of blended biofuels in the Energy Balance visible and to better align with the Energy Balances published by Eurostat and the International Energy Agency. Within renewable energy and biomass, pure and blended biofuels are now visible as separate energy commodities.\n\nIn addition, the way in which electric road transport is treated has been improved, resulting in an increase in the supply and final consumption of electricity in services by more than 2 PJ in 2021 and 2022.\n\nChanges as of November 14th 2023:\nFigures for 2021 and 2022 haven been adjusted.\nFigures for the Energy Balance for 2015 to 2020 have been revised regarding the following items:\n-\tFor 2109 and 2020 final consumption of heat in agriculture is a few PJ lower and for services a few PJ higher. This is the result of improved interpretation of available data in supply of heat to agriculture.\n-\tDuring the production of geothermal heat by agriculture natural gas is produced as by-product. Now this is included in the energy balance. The amount increased from 0,2 PJ in 2015 to 0,7 PJ in 2020.\n-\tThere are some improvements in the data for heat in industry with a magnitude of about 1 PJ or smaller.\n-\tThere some other improvements, also about 1 PJ or smaller.\n\n\nChanges as of October 10th 2023:\nEnergy commodity gas works cokes has been added.\nRevised figures for period 1946-1989 have been added.\n\nChanges as of June 15th 2023:\nRevised provisional figures of 2022 have been added.\n\nWhen will new figures be published?\nProvisional figures: April of the following year.\nRevised provisional figures: June\/July of the following year.\nDefinite figures: December of the second following year.\n\n","TitleColumn":"Energy commodities | Periods | Energy supply | Total Primary Energy Supply (TPES) | Indigenous production | Imports | Exports | Net imports | Bunkers | Stock change | Statistical differences | Total energy consumption | Energy transformation | Energy transformation input | Total energy transformation input | Electricity and CHP transformation input | Other transformation input | Energy transformation output | Total energy transformation output | Electricity\/CHP transformation output | Other transformation output | Net energy transformation | Total net energy transformation | Net electricity\/CHP transformation | Net other transformation | Own use | Total | Production of heat and power | Extraction of crude petroleum and gas | Coke-oven plants | Blast furnaces | Oil refinery installations | Other installations | Distribution losses | Final consumption | Total final consumption | Final energy consumption | Industry (excluding the energy sector) | Iron and steel | Chemical and petrochemical | Non-ferrous metals | Non-metallic minerals | Transport equipment | Machinery | Mining and quarrying | Food and tobacco | Paper, pulp and printing | Wood and wood products | Construction | Textile and leather | Other industry and non-specified | Transport | Domestic aviation | Road transport | Rail transport | Pipeline transport | Domestic navigation | Non-specified | Other sectors | Services, waste, water and repair | Dwellings | Agriculture | Fishing | Non-energy use | Of which chemical and petrochemical"}

The average purchase price of existing own homes may differ from the price index of existing own homes. The average purchase price is no indicator for price developments of owner-occupied residential property. The average purchase price reflects the average price of dwellings sold in a particular period. The fact that de dwellings sold differs from one period to another is not taken into account. The following instance explains which problems are entailed by the continually changing of the quality of the dwellings sold. Suppose in February of a particular year mainly big houses with extensive gardens beautifully situated alongside canals are sold, whereas in March many small terraced houses are sold. In that case the average purchase price in February will be higher than in March but this does not mean that house prices are increased. See note 3 for a link to the article 'Why the average purchase price is not an indicator'.\n\nData available from: 1995\n\nStatus of the figures:\nThe figures in this table are immediately definitive. The calculation of these figures is based on the number of notary transactions that are registered every month by the Dutch Land Registry Office (Kadaster).

The average purchasing prices of existing owner-occupied sold homes can be calculated by Kadaster at a later date. These figures are usually the same as the publication on Statline, but in some periods  they differ. Kadaster calculates the average purchasing prices based on the most recent data.

{"Identifier":"83989ENG","TitleTable":"Energy balance sheet; supply and consumption, sector","Summary":"Supply, consumption, energy transformation\nEnergy commodities, sector","Period":"1990-2023","ShortDescription":"\nThis table contains figures on the supply and consumption of energy broken down by sector and by energy commodity. The energy supply is equal to the indigenous production of energy plus the receipts minus the deliveries of energy plus the stock changes. Consumption of energy is equal to the sum of own use, distribution losses, final energy consumption, non-energy use and the total net energy transformation. For each sector, the supply of energy is equal to the consumption of energy.\n\nFor some energy commodities, the total of the observed domestic deliveries is not exactly equal to the sum of the observed domestic receipts. For these energy commodities, a statistical difference arises that can not be attributed to a sector.\n\nThe breakdown into sectors follows mainly the classification as is customary in international energy statistics. This classification is based on functions of various sectors in the energy system and for several break downs on the international Standard Industrial Classification (SIC). There are two main sectors: the energy sector (companies with main activity indigenous production or transformation of energy) and energy consumers (other companies, vehicles and dwellings). In addition to a breakdown by sector, there is also a breakdown by energy commodity, such as coal, various petroleum products, natural gas, renewable energy, electricity and heat and other energy commodities like non renewable waste.\n\nThe definitions used in this table are exactly in line with the definitions in the Energy Balance table; supply, transformation and consumption. That table does not contain a breakdown by sector (excluding final energy consumption), but it does provide information about imports, exports and bunkering and also provides more detail about the energy commodities.\n\nData available:\nFrom: 1990.\n\nStatus of the figures:\nFigures up to and including 2022 are definite. Figures for 2023 are revised provisional. \n\nChanges as of November 15th 2024:\nThe structure of the table has been adjusted. The adjustment concerns the division into sectors, with the aluminum industry now being distinguished separately within the non-ferrous metal sector.\nThis table has also been revised for 2015 to 2021 as a result of new methods that have also been applied for 2022 and 2023. This concerns the following components: final energy consumption of LPG, distribution of final energy consumption of motor gasoline, sector classification of gas oil\/diesel within the services and transfer of energy consumption of the nuclear industry from industry to the energy sector. The natural gas consumption of the wood and wood products industry has also been improved so that it is more comparable over time. This concerns changes of a maximum of a few PJ.\n\nChanges as of June 7th 2024:\nRevised provisional figures of 2023 have been added.\n\nChanges as of April 26th of 2024\nThe energy balance has been revised for 2015 and later on a limited number of points. The most important is the following:\n1. For solid biomass and municipal waste, the most recent data have been included. Furthermore data were affected by integration with figures for a new, yet to be published StatLine table on the supply of solid biomass. As a result, there are some changes in receipts of energy, deliveries of energy and indigenous production of biomass of a maximum of a few PJ.\n2. In the case of natural gas, an improvement has been made in the processing of data for stored LNG, which causes a shift between stock changes, receipts of energy and deliveries of energy of a maximum of a few PJ.\n\nChanges as of March 25th of 2024:\nThe energy balance has been revised and restructured. This concerns mainly the following:\n1. Different way of dealing with biofuels that have been mixed with fossil fuels\n2. A breakdown of the natural gas balance of agriculture into greenhouse horticulture and other agriculture.\n3. Final consumption of electricity in services \n\n1. Blended biofuels\nPreviously, biofuels mixed with fossil fuels were counted as petroleum crude and products. In the new energy balance, blended biofuels count for renewable energy and petroleum crude and products and the underlying products (such as gasoline, diesel and kerosene) only count the fossil part of mixtures of fossil and biogenic fuels. To make this clear, the names of the energy commodities have been changed. The consequence of this adjustment is that part of the energy has been moved from petroleum to renewable. The energy balance remains the same for total energy commodities. The aim of this adjustment is to make the increasing role of blended biofuels in the Energy Balance visible and to better align with the Energy Balances published by Eurostat and the International Energy Agency. Within renewable energy, biomass, liquid biomass is now a separate energy commodity. This concerns both pure and blended biofuels.\n\n2. Greenhouse horticulture separately\nThe energy consumption of agriculture in the Netherlands largely takes place in greenhouse horticulture. There is therefore a lot of attention for this sector and the need for separate data on energy consumption in greenhouse horticulture. To meet this need, the agriculture sector has been divided into two subsectors: Greenhouse horticulture and other agriculture. For the time being, we only publish separate natural gas figures for greenhouse horticulture.\n\n3. Higher final consumption of electricity in services in 2021 and 2022.\nThe way in which electric road transport is treated has improved, resulting in an increase in the supply and final consumption of electricity in services by more than 2 PJ in 2021 and 2022. This also works through the supply of electricity in sector H (Transport and storage).\n\nChanges as of November 14th 2023:\nFigures for 2021 and 2022 haven been adjusted.\nFigures for the Energy Balance for 2015 to 2020 have been revised regarding the following items:\n-\tFor 2109 and 2020 final consumption of heat in agriculture is a few PJ lower and for services a few PJ higher. This is the result of improved interpretation of available data in supply of heat to agriculture.\n-\tDuring the production of geothermal heat by agriculture natural gas is produced as by-product. Now this is included in the energy balance. The amount increased from 0,2 PJ in 2015 to 0,7 PJ in 2020.\n-\tThere are some improvements in the data for heat in industry with a magnitude of about 1 PJ or smaller.\n-\tThere some other improvements, also about 1 PJ or smaller.\n\nChanges as of June 15th 2023:\nRevised provisional figures of 2022 have been added.\n\nChanges as of December 15th 2022:\nFigures for 1990 up to and including 2019 have been revised. The revision mainly concerns the consumption of gas- and diesel oil and energy commodities higher in the classification (total petroleum products, total crude and petroleum produtcs and total energy commodities).\nThe revision is twofold:\n-\tNew data for the consumption of diesel oil in mobile machine have been incorporated. Consequently, the final energy consumption of gas- and diesel oil in construction, services and agriculture increases. The biggest change is in construction (+10 PJ from 1990-2015, decreasing to 1 PJ in 2019. In agriculture the change is about 0.5-1.5 PJ from 2010 onwards and for services the change is between 0 and 3 PJ for the whole period.\n-\tThe method for dealing with the statistical difference has been adapted. Earlier from 2013 onwards a difference of about 3 percent was assumed, matching old data (up to and including 2012) on final consumption of diesel for road transport based on the dedicated tax specifically for road that existed until 2012. In the new method the statistical difference is eliminated from 2015 onwards. Final consumption of road transport is calculated as the remainder of total supply to the market of diesel minus deliveries to users other than road transport.\nThe first and second item affect both final consumption of road transport that decreases consequently about 5 percent from 2015 onwards. Before the adaption of the tax system for gas- and diesel oil in 2013 the statistical difference was positive (more supply than consumption). With the new data for mobile machines total consumption has been increased and the statistical difference has been reduced and is even negative for a few years.\n\n\nChanges as of 1 March 2022:\nFigures for 1990 up to and including 2020 have been revised. The most important change is a different way of presenting own use of electricity of power-generating installations. Previously, this was regarded as electricity and CHP transformation input. From now on, this is seen as own use, as is customary in international energy statistics. As a result, the input and net energy transformation decrease and own use increases, on average about 15 PJ per year. Final consumers also have power generating installations. That's why final consumers now also have own use, previously this was not so. In the previous revision of 2021, the new sector blast furnaces was introduced for the years 2015 up to and including 2020, which describes the transformation of coke oven coke and coking coal into blast furnace gas that takes place in the production of pig iron from iron ore. This activity was previously part of the steel industry. With this revision, the change has been put back to 1990.\n\n\nWhen will new figures be published?\nRevised provisional figures: June\/July of the following year.\nDefinite figures: December of the second following year.\n\n","TitleColumn":"Energy commodities | Sectors | Periods | From supply | Total Primary Energy Supply | Indigenous production | Receipts of energy | Deliveries of energy (-) | Stock change | Statistical differences | From consumption | Total energy consumption | Energy transformation | Total net energy transformation | Net electricity\/CHP transformation | Net other transformation | Energy transformation input | Electricity and CHP transformation input | Other transformation input | Energy transformation output (-) | Electricity\/CHP transformation output | Other transformation output | Own use | Distribution losses | Final energy consumption | Non-energy use"}

Consumption of electricity is calculated from the supply variables. The supply of electricity primarily includes production plus imports minus exports. The majority of the electricity produced is supplied to the public electricity grid by, for example, power stations and wind turbines. A smaller part is generated by companies themselves for the benefit of their own business processes. For example, many greenhouse companies generate their own electricity for the lighting of their greenhouses. \n\nThe net production is determined as gross production minus the own consumption of electricity. Own consumption is the amount of electricity that a producer or installation consumes during electricity production. The net production is broken down in this table into the following energy sources from which the electricity is produced: nuclear energy, coal, petroleum products, natural gas, biomass, other fuels (non-renewable), hydro power, wind energy, solar photovoltaic and other sources. \n\nImports and exports are further broken down by country of origin or destination. \n\nThe total net consumption of electricity in the Netherlands is calculated as the net production plus imports minus exports and distribution losses. \n\nData available: \nFrom 1936 per year and from 1976 per month only the total production, imports and exports are known. \nFull data per month is available from 2015. \n\nStatus of the figures: \n- All figures up to and including reporting year 2022 are definite. \n- Figures for 2023 are revised provisional.\n- Figures for 2024 are provisional.\n\nChanges as of December 20th of 2024:\nFigures for October have been added.\n\nChanges as of November 29th of 2024:\nFigures for September have been added.\n\nChanges as of November 20th of 2024:\nThis table has been revised for 2015 to 2021 as a result of new methods that have also been applied for 2022 and 2023.

The general government output is determined from the production costs, which consist of compensation of employees, intermediate consumption, consumption of fixed capital, other taxes on production (payable) and other subsidies on production (receivable). Please note that the subsidies are denoted with a negative sign, as subsidies reduce production costs.\nGeneral government output is predominantly comprised of non-market output that is provided for free. To a lesser extent, output of the general government is also sold on the market, used as output for own final use, or provided to the market as non-market output at prices that are not economically significant.\nThe final consumption expenditure of the general government can be broken down into an individual and collective component. The individual consumption expenditure is equal to the social transfers in kind, which are individual goods and services supplied to individual households for free or at prices that are not economically significant, either produced as non-market output or purchased from market producers. The collective consumption expenditure are the costs associated with providing collective goods and services to society, or large parts of it, as a whole.\nThe terms and definitions used are in accordance with the framework of the National Accounts. The National Accounts are based on the international definitions of the European System of Accounts (ESA 2010). The time of recording is in congruence with the accrual principle. Small temporary differences with publications of National Accounts may occur due to the fact that government finance statistics are sometimes more up to date.\n\nData available from:\nYearly figures from 1995.\n\nStatus of the figures:\nThe figures for the period 1995-2022 are final.

Figures are presented in an absolute way, as well as related to the total energy use in the Netherlands.\nThe total gross final energy consumption in the Netherlands (the denominator used to calculate the percentage of renewable energy per \u2018Energy sources and techniques\u2019) can be found in the table as \u2018Total, including non-renewables\u2019 and Energy application \u2018Total\u2019. \nThe gross final energy consumption for the energy applications \u2018Electricity\u2019 and \u2018Heat\u2019 are also available. With these figures the percentages of the different energy sources and applications can be calculated; these values are not available in this table. \nThe gross final energy consumption for \u2018Transport\u2019 is not available because of the complexity to calculate this. More information on this can be found in the yearly publication \u2018Hernieuwbare energie in Nederland\u2019.\n\nRenewable energy is energy from wind, hydro power, the sun, the earth, heat from outdoor air and biomass. This is energy from natural processes that is replenished constantly.\n\nThe figures are broken down into energy source\/technique and into energy application (electricity, heat and transport).\n\nThis table focuses on the share of renewable energy according to the EU Renewable Energy Directive. Under this directive, countries can apply an administrative transfer by purchasing renewable energy from countries that have consumed more renewable energy than the agreed target. For 2020, the Netherlands has implemented such a transfer by purchasing renewable energy from Denmark. This transfer has been made visible in this table as a separate energy source\/technique and two totals are included; a total with statistical transfer and a total without statistical transfer.\n\nFigures for 2020 and before were calculated based on RED I; in accordance with Eurostat these figures will not be modified anymore. Inconsistencies with other tables undergoing updates may occur.\n\nData available from:\n1990\n\nStatus of the figures:\nThis table contains definite figures up to and including 2022 and figures of 2023 are revised provisional figures. \n\nChanges as of November 15th 2024\nFigures for 2021-2023 have been adjusted. 2022 is now definitive, 2023 stays revised provisional. Because of new insights for windmills regarding own electricity use and capacity, figures on 2021 have been revised.\n\n\nChanges as of June 7th 2024\nRevised provisional figures of 2023 have been added.\n\nChanges as of March 2024:\nFigures of the total energy applications of biogas, co-digestion of manure and other biogas have been restored for 2021 and 2022. The final energy consumption of non-compliant biogas (according to RED II) was wrongly included in the total final consumption of these types of biogas. Figures of total biogas, total biomass and total renewable energy were not influenced by this and therefore not adjusted. \n\nChanges as of November 2023:\nFigures of 2021 and 2022 have been updated. The status for figures of 2021 is now definite and the status for figures of 2022 is revised provisional.\nA new category \"Total, including non-renewables\" has been added from 1990 and further. Also the category \"Biokerosene\" has been added since 2022.\n\n\nWhen will new figures be published?\nProvisional figures on the gross final consumption of renewable energy in broad outlines for the previous year are published each year in June. Revised provisional figures for the previous year appear each year in June.\n\nIn November all figures on the consumption of renewable energy in the previous year will be published. These figures remain revised provisional, definite figures appear in November two years after the reporting year. Most important (expected) changes between revised provisional figures in November and definite figures a year later are the figures on solar photovoltaic energy. The figures on the share of total energy consumption in the Netherlands could also still be changed by the availability of adjusted figures on total energy consumption.\n\n","TitleColumn":"Energy sources and techniques | Energy application | Periods | Final consumption | Final consumption relative"}

Renewable energy is energy from wind, hydro power, the sun, the earth, heat from outdoor air and biomass. This is energy from natural processes that is replenished constantly.\n\nFigures are presented in an absolute way, as well as related to the total emission of carbon dioxide in the Netherlands.\n\nAvoiding the use of fossil energy and avoiding emission of carbon dioxide are important underlying aims for stimulation of the use of renewable energy.\n\nThe figures are broken down into energy source\/technique and into application (electricity, heat and transport).\n\nFrom reporting year 2021, new sustainability criteria for solid and gaseous biomass will apply in the context of the EU Renewable Energy Directive (2018). Only solid and gaseous biomass compliant according to these criteria are used to determine the avoided use of fossil energy and emission of CO2 in 2021.\nAn exception applies to the biogas used for bio-methane production. The current methodology doesn\u2019t discern sustainable from non-sustainable biogas used for bio-methane production. This differs from the methodology used for gross final energy consumption that is the basis of most statistics on renewable energy.\n\n\nData available from:\n1990\n\nStatus of the figures:\nThis table contains definite figures up to and including 2021, revised provisional figures for 2022 and provisional figures for 2023.\n\nChanges as of August 16th 2024\nFigures have been added for 2023. \n\nSince 2022, final energy consumption of bio jet kerosene is reported in the Netherlands. This bio jet kerosene is used by the (international) aviation sector, which is not included in the primary energy consumption. However, because international air traffic is considered in the calculation of the gross final energy consumption, which forms the basis for calculating the avoided energy consumption, bio jet kerosene has been added to this table. The figures on bio jet kerosene for 2022 will be included in the next update of this reporting year.\n\nDue to the addition of bio-kerosene to this table, the calculation of the denominators has also been adjusted. The consumption and emissions of international air traffic are included in the denominators for the figures starting from 2023, in order to calculate the relative figures in the table, as is the case for the denominator of gross final consumption.\n\n\nWhen will new figures be published?\nProvisional figures: June of the following year.\nRevised provisional figures: December of the following year.\nDefinite figures: December of the second following year.\n\n","TitleColumn":"Energy sources\/techniques | Energy application | Periods | Avoided use of fossil energy | Avoided energy | Avoided energy relative | Avoided carbon dioxide emission (CO2) | Avoided emission | Avoided emission relative"}

The figures can be broken down by industry according to Statistics Netherlands' Standard Industrial Classification of all Economic Activities 2008 (SIC 2008). The change is shown both as a percentage change compared to a previous period and through index figures with 2021 as base year.\n\nTurnover and production changes are published in two forms. Firstly, as year-on-year changes where the growth is expressed relative to the same period in the previous year. These figures are presented unadjusted and calendar-adjusted. The second form represents period-on-period changes: month-on-month and quarter-on-quarter. Period-on-period changes are possible by applying seasonal adjustment.\n\nCurrently, this table exclusively comprises seasonally- and calendar adjusted data pertaining to monthly records for the retail sector. For other sectors, the unadjusted monthly series only extend back to January 2021, complicating the process of conducting adjustments. The lack of sufficient historical data makes it challenging to identify consistent patterns and trends, which is crucial for accurate adjustments. Some data may not be representative of all seasonal influences occurring over a longer period, potentially leading to less reliable or even incorrect adjustments. As the unadjusted monthly series lengthens, more reliable adjustments can be made. Therefore, in the spring of 2025, the table will be expanded to include seasonally- and calendar adjusted records for other sectors, retroactively from January 2021.\n\nData available from: January 2000 for branches within SIC division 47 and first quarter of 2005 for all other branches.\n\nStatus of figures:\nFigures for 2024 are provisional, other figures are final. \n\nThe figures of a calendar year become final no later than six months after the end of that calendar year. Due to delayed response, provisional figures may still change.\n\nChanges as of December 2, 2024:\nFigures of industries belonging to NACE sections G, H, I, J, L, M, N and S have been added. These are figures for the period October far as retail trade is concerned and September for other industries.\nFigures of the third quarter of 2024 may have been adjusted.\n\nTo keep the results of these index series in line with current events, a so-called base year change is carried out once every five years. In 2024, the publication of this table switched from reference year 2015 to 2021 (2021=100) and the weighting factors were updated and based on the year 2021. \n\nThis table combines data from 9 separate former tables. Which tables this concerns can be found later in this table explanation under \"3. Links to relevant tables and articles\".\n\nWhen are new figures released?\nFor monthly business statistics, figures are published as a rule 2 months after the end of the reporting month, figures for the retail trade sector and imports of new passenger cars and light commercial vehicles are published 1 month after the end of the reporting month. After publication of final results, Statistics Netherlands adjusts the figures only if major adjustments and\/or corrections are necessary.\n\n","TitleColumn":"Branches | Periods | Turnover | Value | Indices | Uncorrected production\/turnover | Calendar adjusted production\/turnover | Seasonally adjusted production\/turnover | Development compared to a year earlier | Development compared to previous period | Volume | Production"}
