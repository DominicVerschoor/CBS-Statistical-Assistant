    "period": "1946 - November 2024",
    "short_description": "\nThis table shows the supply and the consumption of natural gas as a balance sheet. The supply of natural gas is calculated as the sum of indigenous production, production from other sources, imports minus exports, minus delivery of fuels for international shipping (bunkers) plus stock changes. The supply is equal to the amount of natural gas used in the Netherlands in the same period.\n\nThis consumption is broken down by how it's delivered by the gas distribution network. This consists of a main grid and connected regional grids. Large-scale consumers, like power plants and large companies, receive the gas directly from the main distribution network. Small-scale consumers, including households, receive their natural gas through the regional grids. Then a small amount of natural gas is used in the indigenous production and transportation of natural gas. Lastly, there is flared and vented natural gas.\n\nData available:\nFrom 1946 annually and from 1982 annually, quarterly and monthly.\n\nStatus of the figures:\n - up to and including 2022 definite.\n - 2023 is revised provisional.\n - 2024 is provisional.\n\nChanges as of December 13th 2024:\nFigures for November 2024 have been added.\n\nChanges as of November 29th 2024:\nFigures of October 2024 have been updated.\n\nChanges as of November 15th 2024:\nFigures for October 2024 have been added. This table has also been revised for 2015 to 2021 as a result of new methods that have also been applied for 2022 and 2023. This concerns the following components: final energy consumption of LPG and the natural gas consumption of the wood and wood products industry has also been improved so that it is more comparable over time. This concerns changes of a maximum of a few PJ.\n\nChanges as of Oktober 31st 2024:\nFigures for September 2024 have been updated.\n\nChanges as of October 15th of 2024:\nFigures of September 2024 have been added.\n\n\nWhen will new figures be published?\nProvisional figures: half a month after the month under review.\nRevised provisional figures: not later than in June of the year following the reporting year.\nDefinite figures: not later than December of the second following year. \n\n",

These cases were included in the final figures for previous years. However, the 2023 data shows a larger number of children born at an unknown gestational age than in previous years.

        "Description": "The number of years a person of a certain age can (still) expect to live without psychological complaints. Figures on this variant of healthy life expectancy will no longer be provided from statistical year 2024 onwards.\r\nThe calculation of psychological complaints is, until 2023, based on the scores on the Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5). Therefore the following questions of the health survey are used:\r\nDuring the past 4 weeks, how much of the time.:\r\n-Have you been a very nervous person?\r\n-Did you feel depressed?\r\n-Have you felt calm and peaceful?\r\n-Have you felt downhearted and blue?\r\n-Were you a happy person?\r\nThe possible answers to these questions are: 'all of the time', 'most of the time', 'a good bit of the time', 'some of the time', 'a little of the time' and 'non of the time'. Positively phrased questions are scored respectively 5,4,3,2,1 and 0. Negatively phrased questions are scored 0,1,2,3,4 and 5. For every respondent a sum score is being calculated\r\nwhich is multiplied by 4. Therefore the minimum score of a person is 0 (very unhealthy) and the maximum score is 100 (perfectly healthy. Every respondent with a score of 60 or more is considered to have no psychological complaints.\r\nThe questions of the Mental Health Inventory are only asked to people aged 12 and older. In the calculation of the life expectancy without psychological complaints\r\n the assumption is made that children younger than 12 years have the same prevalence of psychological complaints as people of 12 through 14 years.\r\nUp to 2023, life expectancy without psychological complaints was referred to as life expectancy in good mental health.\r\nResearchers from the Trimbos Institute recalibrated the MHI in 2024 and determined that the previously used cut-off point of 60 was no longer adequate for a number of reasons. It was also determined that the indicator \u2018psychological distress\u2019 would be better replaced by the indicator \u2018feelings of anxiety or depression\u2019, where an MHI sum score of 76 or lower determines whether or not you have those feelings. As of 10 September 2024, the indicator \u2018feelings of anxiety or depression in the past 4 weeks\u2019 will therefore replace the indicator \u2018psychological distress in the past 4 weeks\u2019. More information about the recalibration of the MHI can be found in a fact sheet from the Trimbos Institute (see table explanation). The variable \u2018Psychological distress\u2019 will therefore no longer be supplemented from 2024 onwards. As a result, the indicator on life expectancy psychological complaints will also no longer be supplemented from statistical year 2024 onwards. The CBS will not calculate a healthy life expectancy based on the variable \u201cFeelings of anxiety or depression in the past 4 weeks\u201d.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

These enterprises are called technological innovators. For the innovators with completed innovations a distinction is made between product innovations process innovations. Furthermore the table includes data on the number of enterprises that have cooperated with one or more partners in developing technological innovations. \n\nThe scope of this table is limited to technological innovations. Non-technological innovations are left out. However, the definition of a technological innovation is subject to change and is not the same for all reference periods. Up to and including the reference period 2014-2016, organisational innovations and marketing innovations were inquired separately and were subsequently classified as non-technological. As of the reference period 2016-2018, these innovations are a part of the process innovations and are therefore classified as technological.\n\nThe data are the results of the two-yearly community innovation survey. Each survey reports on three years, for example 2016 up to and including 2018 (this is the reference period). Here the last year in a survey is the same as the first year in the subsequent survey. That means the periods partially overlap.\n\nData available from: 1994-1996\n\nStatus of the figures:\nThe data regarding the periods up to and including 2018-2020 are definitive and the data regarding the period 2020-2022 are revised provisional.\n\nChanges as of 6 September 2024:\nThe revised provisional figures about 2020-2022 have been published.\n\nIn addition, in the periods 2016-2018 and 2018-2020, the figure on co-operating innovators accidentally included non-innovation related co-operation. As a result, said figure was too high. This has now been rectified and the correct figures have been published. The other figures for the aforementioned periods are unchanged.\n\nWhen will new figures be published?\nMid 2026 the figures about 2022-2024 will be published.\n\n",

    "short_description": "\nThe historical series 'New dwellings; output price indices building costs 2000=100, since 1914' shows cost developments of residential building through time and has become available by linking series which were calculated separately in the past.\n\nFrom 1914 up to and including the 4th quarter of 1991, the indices are based on the analysis of council housing data carried out by the Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment. \nSubsequently, until 1995, index figures are based on the number of building permits issued in the council housing sector. Since 1995, they are based on data from building permits of all dwellings.\n\nData available from:\nData including VAT are available from 1914 and excluding VAT from 1969. \nIn the historical series, annual figures are only available for the period 1914-1949. From 1950 onwards, quarterly figures are also available.\n\nStatus of the figures:\nThe historical series with base year 2000=100 was calculated for the first time in January 2010. Because the historical series 2000=100 is calculated by linking successive, independent series, it is in fact an estimate. \nPrice differences as a result of changes in realisation and quality are eliminated as much as possible within the original series. The figures remain preliminary four quarters before they become definite. \n\nChanges as of December 30th 2024:\nThe figures of the 3rd quarter of 2023 are modified into definitive figures. Furthermore the figures of the 3rd quarter of 2024 are added.\n\nWhen will new figures become available?\nProvisional figures for the 4th quarter of 2024 will be released in March 2025.\n",

    "period": "1995 - 2023",
    "short_description": "\nThis table gives an overview of expenditure on regular education within the Netherlands. \n\nThe government finances schools, colleges and universities. It pays for research which is done by universities on its behalf. Furthermore it provides student grants and loans, allowances for school costs, provisions for students with a disability and child care allowances as well as subsidies to companies and non-profit organisations. The government reclaims unjustified payments for student grants and loans and allowances for school costs. It also receives interest and repayments on student loans as well as EU subsidies for education. \n\nParents and/or students have to pay tuition fees for schools, colleges and universities, parent contributions and contributions for school activities. They also have to purchase books and materials, pay for transport from home to school and back for students who are not eligible for subsidised transport, pay for private tutoring, pay interest and repayments on student loans, and repay wrongfully received student grants, loans and allowances for school costs. Parents and/or students receive child care allowances, provisions for students with a disability and an allowance for school costs as well as student grants and loans and scholarships of companies.\n\nCompanies and non-profit organisations incur costs for supervising trainees and apprentices who combine learning with work experience. They also contribute to the cost of work related education of their employees and spend money on research that is outsourced to colleges for higher professional education and universities. Furthermore they contribute to the childcare allowances given to households and provide scholarships to students. Companies receive subsidies and tax benefits for the creation of apprenticeship places and trainee placements and for providing transport for pupils.\n\nOrganisations abroad contract universities in the Netherlands to undertake research for them. The European Union provides funds and subsidies for education to schools, colleges and universities as well as to the Dutch government. Foreign governments contribute to international schools in the Netherlands that operate under their nationality.\n\nThe table also contains various indicators used nationally and internationally to compare expenditure on education and place it in a broader context. The indicators are compounded on the basis of definitions of Statistics Netherlands and/or the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development). All figures presented have been calculated according to the standardised definitions of the OECD.\n\nIn this table tertiary education includes research and development, except for the indicator Expenditure on education institutions per student, excluding R&D.\n\nThe statistic on Education spending is compiled on a cash basis. This means that the education expenditure and revenues are allocated to the year in which they are paid out or received. However, the activity or transaction associated with the payment or receipt can take place in a different year.\n\nStatistics Netherlands published the revised National Accounts in June 2024. Among other things, GDP and total government expenditures have been adjusted upwards as a result of the revision.\n\nData available from: 1995\n\nStatus of the figures:\nThe figures from 1995 to 2022 are final. The 2023 figures are provisional.\n\nChanges as of 31 December 2024:\nThe final figures of 2021 and 2022 and the provisional figures of 2023 have been added. \nAs a result of the revision of the National Accounts, among other things, GDP and total government expenditures have been adjusted upwards. The indicators in this table that are expressed as a percentage of GDP and total government expenditure have been updated for the entire time series from 1995 on the basis of the revised figures.\n\nWhen will new figures be published?\nThe final figures for 2023 and the provisional figures for 2024 will be published in December 2025.\nMore information on the revision policy of National Accounts can be found under 'relevant articles' under paragraph 3.\n",

Changes in other cost components such as building equipment (tools and machines), general costs, profits and risk are not included in the index. Other cost components, such as energy and transport, are also not taken into account as their influence on the final cost price is relatively modest. Land costs are also not included in the index.\n\nFrom 1990 to December 1994 only figures of the materials are available. \nFrom 1995 onwards this series also includes wage figures. Also from 1995, figures are also available on total building costs by weighted aggregetion of these two series.\n\nData available from: \n- Materials: January 1990\n- Wages: January 1995\n- Total building costs: January 1995\n\nStatus of the figures:\nThe price index figures for wages and the total construction costs are final until 2023.\nThe figures for building materials are final until June 2024.\n\nChanges as of November 29th, 2024:\nSince this publication, a switch has been made to a different rounding strategy, whereby the changes are calculated on unrounded index figures and annual figures are calculated from rounded and published figures.

All figures presented have been calculated according to the standardised definitions of the OECD.\n\nGovernment expenditure on education consists of expenditure by central and local government on education institutions and education. The government finances schools, colleges and universities. It pays for research and development conducted by universities. Furthermore it provides student grants and loans, allowances for school costs, provisions for students with a disability and child care allowances to households as well as subsidies to companies and non-profit organisations.\n\nTotal government expenditure is broken down into expenditure on education institutions and education on the one hand and government expenditure on student grants and loans and allowances for school costs to households on the other. If applicable these subjects are broken down into pre-primary and primary education, special needs primary education, secondary education, senior secondary vocational and adult education, higher professional education and university education. Data are available from 1900. Figures for the Second World War period are based on estimations due to a lack of source material.\n\nThe table also includes the indicator government expenditure on education as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP). This indicator is used to compare government expenditure on education internationally. The indicator is compounded on the basis of definitions of the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development). The indicator is also presented in the StatLine table Education; Education expenditure and CBS /OECD indicators. Figures for the First World War and Second World War period are not available for this indicator due to a lack of reliable data on GDP for these periods.\n\nThe statistic on Education spending is compiled on a cash basis. This means that the education expenditure and revenues are allocated to the year in which they are paid out or received. However, the activity or transaction associated with the payment or receipt can take place in a different year.\n\nStatistics Netherlands published the revised National Accounts in June 2024. Among other things, GDP has been adjusted upwards as a result of the revision. The revision has not been extended to the years before 1995. In the indicator 'Total government expenditure as % of GDP', a break occurs between 1994 and 1995 as a result of the revision.\n\nData available from: 1900\n\nStatus of the figures:\nThe figures from 1995 to 2022 are final. The 2023 figures are provisional.\n\nChanges on 31 December 2024:\nThe final figures of 2021 and 2022 and the provisional figures of 2023 have been added. \nAs a result of the revision of the National Accounts, among other things, GDP has been adjusted upwards. The indicator \u2018Total government expenditure as % of GDP\u2019 in this table has been updated on the basis of the revised figures for the entire time series since 1995. A break occurs in the indicator between 1994 and 1995.\n\nWhen will new figures be published?\nThe final figures for 2023 and the provisional figures for 2024 will be published in December 2025.\nMore information on the revision policy of National Accounts can be found under 'relevant articles' under paragraph 3.\n",

    "summary": "Agricultural census; crops, livestock, land use and corresponding\nnumber of holdings by general farm type and region",
    "period": "2000 - 2024",
    "short_description": "\nThis table contains data on land use, arable farming, horticulture, grassland, grazing livestock and housed animals, at regional level, by general farm type.\n\nThe figures in this table are derived from the agricultural census. Data collection for the agricultural census is part of a combined data collection for a.o. agricultural policy use and enforcement of the manure law.\n\nRegional breakdown is based on the main location of the holding. Due to this the region where activities (crops, animals) are allocated may differ from the location where these activities actually occur.\n\nThe agricultural census is also used as the basis for the European Farm Structure Survey (FSS). Data from the agricultural census do not fully coincide with the FSS. In the FSS years (2000, 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2010)  additional information was collected to meet the requirements of the FSS.\n\nReference date for livestock is 1 April and for crops 15 May.\n\nIn 2022, equidae are not part of the Agricultural Census. This affects the farm type and the total number of farms in the Agricultural Census. Farms with horses, ponies and donkeys that were previously classified as \u2018specialist grazing livestock' could be classified, according to their dominant activity, as another farm type in 2022.\n\nFrom 2020 onwards, the SO2017, based on the years 2015 to 2019, will apply (see also the explanation for SO: Standard Output).\n\nFrom 2018 onwards the number of calves for fattening, pigs for fattening, chicken and turkey are adjusted in the case of temporary breaks in the production cycle (e.g. sanitary cleaning).\nThe agricultural census is a structural survey, in which adjustment for temporary breaks in the production cycle is a.o. relevant for the calculation of the economic size of the holding, and its farm type.\nIn the livestock surveys the number of animals on the reference day is relevant, therefore no adjustment for temporary breaks in the production cycle are made.\nThis means that the number of animals in the tables of the agricultural census may differ from those in the livestock tables (see \u2018links to relevant tables and relevant articles).\n\nFrom 2017 onwards, animal numbers are increasingly derived from I&R registers (Identification and Registration of animals), instead of by means of the combined data collection. The I&R registers are the responsibility of RVO (Netherlands Enterprise Agency). Since 2017, cattle numbers are derived from I&R cattle, and from 2018 sheep, goats and poultry are also derived from the relevant I&R registers. The registration of cattle, sheep and goats takes place directly at RVO. Poultry data is collected via the designated database Poultry Information System Poultry (KIP) from Avined. Avined is a branch organization for the egg and poultry meat sectors. Avined passes the data on to the central database of RVO. Due to the transition to the use of I&R registers, a change in classification will occur for sheep and goats from 2018 onwards.\n\nSince 2016, information of the Dutch Business Register is used  to define the agricultural census. Registration in the Business Register with an agricultural standard industrial classification code (SIC), related to NACE/ISIC, (in Dutch SBI: \u2018Standaard BedrijfsIndeling\u2019) is leading to determine whether there is an agricultural holding. This aligns the agricultural census  as closely as possible to the statistical regulations of Eurostat and the (Dutch) implementation of the definition of 'active farmer' as described in the common agricultural policy.\n\nThe  definition of the agricultural census based on information from the Dutch Business Register mainly affects the number of holdings, a clear deviation of the trend occurs. The impact on areas (except for other land and rough grazing) and the number of animals (except for sheep, horses and ponies) is limited. This is mainly due  to the holdings that are excluded as a result of the new delimitation of  agricultural holdings (such as equestrian centres, city farms and organisations in nature management).\n\nIn 2011 there were changes in geographic assignment of holdings with a foreign main seat. This may influence regional figures, mainly in border regions.\n\nUntil 2010 the economic size of agricultural holdings was expressed in Dutch size units (in Dutch NGE: 'Nederlandse Grootte Eenheid'). From 2010 onwards this has become Standard Output (SO). This means that the threshold for holdings in the agricultural census has changed from 3 NGE to 3000 euro SO. For comparable time series the figures for 2000 up to and including 2009 have been recalculated, based on SO coefficients and SO typology. The latest update took place in 2016. \n\nData available from: 2000\n\nStatus of the figures: The figures for 2024 are provisional, all other figures are final.\n\nChanges as of November 28, 2024: the provisional figures for 2024 have been added.\n\nWhen will new figures be published?\nAccording to regular planning provisional figures are published in November and the definite figures will follow in March of the following year.\n",

    "title": "Agriculture; labour force by region",
    "summary": "Agricultural census; number of persons, annual work units \nand corresponding number of holdings by region",
    "period": "2000 - 2024",
    "short_description": "\nThis table contains data at regional level on the number of persons employed on agricultural holdings, the corresponding annual work units (AWUs) and the number of holdings with workers.\n\nThe figures in this table are derived from the agricultural census. Data collection for the agricultural census is part of a combined data collection for a.o. agricultural policy use and enforcement of the manure law.\n\nRegional breakdown is based on the main location of the holding. Due to this the region where activities (crops, animals) are allocated may differ from the location where these activities actually occur.\n\nThe agricultural census is also used as the basis for the European Farm Structure Survey (FSS). Data from the agricultural census do not fully coincide with the FSS. In the FSS years (2000, 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2010) \nadditional information was collected to meet the requirements of the FSS.\n\nData on labour force refer to the period April to March of the year preceding the agricultural census.\n\nIn 2022, equidae are not part of the Agricultural Census. This affects the farm type and the total number of farms in the Agricultural Census. Farms with horses, ponies and donkeys that were previously classified as \u2018specialist grazing livestock' could be classified, according to their dominant activity, as another farm type in 2022.\n\nFrom 2018 onwards the number of calves for fattening, pigs for fattening, chicken and turkey are adjusted in the case of temporary breaks in the production cycle (e.g. sanitary cleaning).\nThe agricultural census is a structural survey, in which adjustment for temporary breaks in the production cycle is a.o. relevant for the calculation of the economic size of the holding, and its farm type.\nIn the livestock surveys the number of animals on the reference day is relevant, therefore no adjustment for temporary breaks in the production cycle are made.\nThis means that the number of animals in the tables of the agricultural census may differ from those in the livestock tables (see \u2018links to relevant tables and relevant articles).\n\nFrom 2017 onwards, animal numbers are increasingly derived from I&R registers (Identification and Registration of animals), instead of by means of the combined data collection. The I&R registers are the responsibility of RVO (Netherlands Enterprise Agency). Since 2017, cattle numbers are derived from I&R cattle, and from 2018 sheep, goats and poultry are also derived from the relevant I&R registers. The registration of cattle, sheep and goats takes place directly at RVO. Poultry data is collected via the designated database Poultry Information System Poultry (KIP) from Avined. Avined is a branch organization for the egg and poultry meat sectors. Avined passes the data on to the central database of RVO. Due to the transition to the use of I&R registers, a change in classification will occur for sheep and goats from 2018 onwards.\n\nSince 2016, information of the Dutch Business Register is used  to define the agricultural census. Registration in the Business Register with an agricultural standard industrial classification code, related to NACE/ISIC, (in Dutch SBI: \u2018Standaard BedrijfsIndeling\u2019) is leading to determine whether there is an agricultural holding. This aligns the agricultural census  as closely as possible to the statistical regulations of Eurostat and the (Dutch) implementation of the definition of 'active farmer' as described in the common agricultural policy.\n\nThe  definition of the agricultural census based on information from the Dutch Business Register mainly affects the number of holdings, a clear deviation of the trend occurs. The impact on areas (except for other land and rough grazing) and the number of animals (except for sheep, and horses and ponies) is limited. This is mainly due  to the holdings that are excluded as a result of the new delimitation of  agricultural holdings (such as equestrian centres, city farms and organisations in nature management).\n\nIn 2011 there were changes in geographic assignment of holdings with a foreign main seat. This may influence regional figures, mainly in border regions.\n\nUntil 2010 the economic size of agricultural holdings was expressed in Dutch size units (in Dutch NGE: 'Nederlandse Grootte Eenheid'). From 2010 onwards this has become Standard Output (SO). This means that the threshold for holdings in the agricultural census has changed from 3 NGE to 3000 euro SO. For comparable time series the figures for 2000 up to and including 2009 have been recalculated, based on SO coefficients and SO typology. The latest update was in 2016. \n\nData available from: 2000\n\nStatus of the figures: The figures for 2024 are provisional, all other figures are final.\n\nChanges as of November 28, 2024: the provisional figures for 2024 have been added.\n                \nWhen will new figures be published?\nAccording to regular planning provisional figures for the current year are published in November and the definite figures will follow in March of the following year.\n",

The most important legal tasks are flood defense, water management (ensuring the right water level for agriculture, nature, residents) and ensuring water quality. Some water boards also manage roads and waterways.\nThe water boards impose water system levies, road levies and non-task-related levies (till 2015) on four categories of taxpayers: residents, owners of buildings, owners of land (unbuilt) and owners of nature sites. A water board can choose to impose a separate road levy or to pay the costs of road management and maintenance from the water system levy.\nWater boards can apply tariff differentiation. This means that a water board can use different tariffs for the same levy for, for example, areas outside dikes and inside dikes. If this is the case, the table shows an average rate. To calculate the average rate, the total revenue is divided by the total number of units on which the charge is levied.\nThe data included in this table have been derived from the budgets as reported by the water boards prior to each reporting year.\n\nData available from: 2009\n\nStatus of the figures:\nThe rates for the year 2024 are provisional, rates over previous years are definitive. \nAll provisional figures are subject to adjustments based on new or updated source material.\n\nChanges as of 8 March 2024:\nThe provisional figures for 2024 have been added.\nThe figures for 2023 are definite.\n\nWhen will new figures be published?\nThe new figures from the water board budgets are published in the first quarter of the financial year.\nThe figures can be adjusted on the basis of the availability of new or updated source material. In general, the adjustments are small. The adjustments are made at the moment a new annual figure is added to the series.\n",

    "short_description": "\nThe historical series 'Civil engineering; input price index 2000=100, since 1979' represents the trend of the costs of labour, material and equipment involved in projects in various areas of civil engineering (in Dutch: Grond-, Weg- en Waterbouw (GWW)) in the Netherlands. This series was created by linking independently calculated series from the past.\nAt this moment, there are eight areas within civil engineering. These areas are based on the standard Classification Products to Activity (CPA). There is also one area of which the observation has stopped. For each area a series is calculated based on the price developments of various cost components of which the product to be realised -in this case a civil engineering project- is constructed.. The price index for the total of civil engineering is a weighted average of the eight areas. The published price indices of civil engineering are based on the average price level of the month in question. Changes in the overall costs and 'profit and risks' are not taken into account. Changes in excise duties (such as that of diesel, used in civil engineering works, from 1/1/2013) are also not reflected in the price indices.\nChanges compared with twelve months previously are also published for all <a href='https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/our-services/methods/statistical-methods/output/index-numbers'>indices</a>.\n\nData available from:\nThe various series of price indices of Civil Engineering cover different periods. Some start in 1979, while others start at the shift to 2000=100. For each series, the period for which it contains figures is given below:\n- Constructions for fluids: February 1979\n- Road construction: February 1979\n- Road maintenance: February 1979; discontinued from October 2004\n- Site preparation works: February 1979\n- Civil engineering works: January 2000\n- Bridges and tunnels: January 2000\n- Railways and underground railways: January 2000\n- Constructions for water projects: January 2000\n- Electrical installation works: January 2005\n\nStatus of the figures:\nIndex figures up to 2023 are definite. Other index figures are provisional. The period the price indices remain provisional depends on the moment that the collectively negotiated (CAO) wage rates for the construction industry are definite. This period can vary from 4 to about 16 months after the period under review.\n\nChanges as of November 29th 2024:\nThe figures of October 2024 are added to the table.\n\nWhen will new figures be published? \nProvisional figures for Januari 2025 will be published at the end of Februari 2025.\n",

A Balassa index higher than 1 indicates specialisation in that product; an index lower than 1 means that there is no specialisation in that product.

For the period 1996-2016 this comparison is with the EU-15, for 2017-2020 (January) with the EU-28 and from 2020 (February) with the EU-27.\r\n\r\nFor example, the Balassa index for cereals in 2009 is calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n- Exports of cereals by the Netherlands: 397 million euro\r\n- Total exports of the Netherlands: 309,359 million euro\r\n- Exports of cereals by EU-15 (excluding the Netherlands): 9,916 million euro\r\n- Total exports by EU-15 (excluding the Netherlands): 2,572,634 million euro\r\nThe Balassa index then equals:\r\n\r\n(397 / 309,359 million euro)\r\n--------- divided by --------------- = 0.3\r\n(9,916 / 2,572,634 million euro)\r\n\r\nThe outcome is 0.3 so it is less than 1 which means that the Netherlands has no export specialisation for the export product cereals compared with the EU-15 member states.\r\n\r\n"

    "period": "1900 - 2022",
    "short_description": "\nThis table contains figures on revenues, expenditures and debts of municipalities as of the year 1900, in millions of euros. The figures have been collected from previously published tables on municipal finances and have been based on annual realisation figures. The data presented were taken from the annual accounts and the balance sheets of the respective municipalities, and match as closely as possible the definitions and classifications used by the municipalities themselves in their administration.\n\nImportant events:\n1986 - A different method of financing the homes for the elderly resulted in a visible spike of 2 billion euros in income on the capital account.\n1995 - In this year, municipalities received approximately 15.5 billion euros as a lump-sum payment from Central Government to buy off loans provided under the Housing Act. Through these lump sum payments the loans are repaid, causing the loans to decrease by an equal amount in 1995.\n2008 - As of January 2008 deferred payments  received from European and Dutch governments for a specific purpose (such as the construction of new infrastructure) to cover expenses in previous years, are recorded in the balance sheet differently. From this date onwards they are recorded under deferred liabilities. Previously the amounts were recorded under the provisions. The change in recording has led to a break in the time series concerning the balance between 2007 and 2008. \n2009 - The sale of shares in Nuon and Essent resulted in a visible spike of 5.2 billion euros. Since the received book profit and super dividends are considered part of the current account, the increase is visible there.\n2015 - Due to the transfer of tasks in the area of social support from General Government to municipalities, the revenues and expenses have increased by approximately 7 billion euros. The figures in this table are provisional at the time of first publication. Upon the second publication one year later, the figures will become definitive.\n2020 - The sale of shares in Eneco resulted in additional revenues (book profit) of 4.1 billion euros.\n\nStatus of the figures:\nThe figures for 1900-2021 are definite, the figures for 2022 are provisional. \n\nChanges as of 22 March 2024:\nThe provisional figures for 2022 have been added.\nThe figures for 2021 have been adjusted from provisional to definite.\nFor the year 2020, a 6 million euro correction was not included in the figure for short-term debt and, as a result, also not for total debt. In this version, this correction is included.\n\nWhen will new figures be published?\nThe new figures from the municipal accounts are published no later than 15 months after the reporting period.\nThe figures can be adjusted on the basis of the availability of new or updated source material. In general, the adjustments are small. The adjustments are made the moment a new annual figure is added to the series.\n",

The figures have been collected from previously published tables on provincial finances and have been based on annual realisation figures. The data presented were taken from the annual accounts and the balance sheets of the respective provinces, and match as closely as possible the definitions and classifications used by the provinces themselves in their administration.\n\nImportant events:\n2008 -  As of January 2008, transfers received in advance from European and Dutch governments with a specific spending purpose (. e.g. the construction of new infrastructure) to cover expenses in future years are included in the balance sheet in a different way. From that year onward, these received transfers are included under deferred liabilities. The received transfers were previously booked under the provisions.\nThis led to a break in the figures of the relevant balance sheet items from 2007 to 2008.\n2009 \u2013 Provinces sold their shares in the energy companies Essent and NUON. The result of this transaction was nearly 13 billion euros in revenue.\n2013 - Mandatory Treasury Banking was established by the government. From the end of 2013 onwards, all public authorities must hold their surplus assets with central government (Treasury Banking Act). As an alternative to keeping surplus funds in the treasury, local governments may opt for using these funds to provide loans to each other.\n2014 \u2013 Provinces sold their share in waste processing company Attero.\n2015 - All youth care tasks were transferred from the provinces to the municipalities. In addition in 2015, the task of regional accessibility around large cities (with the exception of Amsterdam and Rotterdam) was transferred from the plus regions (local intergovernmental organisations) to the provinces. On balance, these two changes led to lower revenues and lower expenses for the provinces.\n2016 - The balance of accounts of expenditure and revenue was almost 700 million euros positive in 2016. This positive balance of accounts is partly due to a change in the system for the Provincial Fund. As of 2016, the target payment (BDU) towards traffic and transport became part of the Provincial Fund. With this change, all central government grants received must be accounted for as fair value and not just the part for which expenses are also accounted for (according to BBV regulations).\n2017 - In 2017, the regulations concerning the BBV were renewed. As a result of this renewal, the template  for the Information for Third Parties (Iv3) was changed. With regard to this table, this renewal has not led to a break in the series.\n\nStatus of the figures:\nThe figures in this table are provisional at the time of first publication.

All assets and income of the entity (the debtor) are seized and used to repay the debts. Bankruptcy may be initiated by a creditor, the debtor or the public prosecutor\u2019s office. After payment of the assets and income to the creditors, the bankruptcy is filed as completed, but the debtor is often not free of debts as any residual debts will remain payable. Moreover, a declaration of bankruptcy at the request of a creditor is only possible if there are debts to other creditors as well."

It comprises the following aspects of lifestyle: \n-\tSmoking\n-\tUse of alcohol\n-\tLength, weight, people who are underweight and overweight\n-\tUse of contraceptive pill\nThese aspects are shown for the Caribbean Netherlands, and also for the islands of Bonaire, St Eustatius and Saba separately. Also breakdowns by sex, age and level of education are presented.\nThe research is a sample survey. This means that the figures shown are estimates for which reliability margins apply. These margins are also included in the table. \nThe Omnibus survey was carried out for the first time on Bonaire, Saba and St. Eustatius in 2013 during the month of June and the first week of July. For the second time the Omnibus survey was carried out on Bonaire during the months of October and November 2017, and on Saba and St. Eustatius in the period January to March 2018. In 2021, the survey was conducted from October to December.\n\nData available from: 2013\n\nStatus of the data:\nThe figures for the most recent period are provisional.\n\nChanges as of December 15th 2022\nThe underlying coding of region used in this table has been adjusted.

Figures have been broken down into deep geothermal heat and geothermal energy with or without heat pumps. \n\nGeothermal energy is a form of renewable energy.\n\nWith deep geothermal heat, the pumped up water is sufficiently warm (approximately between 60 and 90 degrees Celsius) for direct consumption via a heat exchanger. The main application is the heating of greenhouses.\n\nWith shallow geothermal energy, the pumped water is usually not warm enough (about 10 degrees Celsius) for direct consumption. This is why heat pumps are often used to bring the temperature to a sufficiently high level.\n\nGeothermal energy can be used both for heating and cooling. The main use of geothermal energy is the heating and cooling of office buildings.\n\nData available from:\n1990\n\nStatus of the figures:\nThe figures in this table are definite up to and including 2022, figures of 2023 are revised provisional\n\nChanges as of November 2024:\nFigures for 2022 and 2023 have been adjusted.

During production, a distinction is made between normalised gross production and non-standard gross and net production without normalisation.\n\nProduction of electricity is shown in million kilowatt hours and as a percentage of total electricity consumption in the Netherlands. The production of renewable electricity is compared with total electricity consumption and not against total electricity production. This choice is due to European conventions.\n\nThe data is broken down according to the type of energy source and the technique used to obtain the electricity. A distinction is made between four main categories: hydro power, wind energy, solar power and biomass.\n\nData available from: 1990.\n\nStatus of the figures: \nThis table contains definite figures until 2022, revised provisional figures for 2023.\n\nChanges as of November 2024:\nFigures for 2021- 2023 have been adjusted. 2022 is now definitive, 2023 stays revised provisional.Because of new insights for windmills regarding own electricity use and capacity, figures on 2021 have been revised.\nThe capacity of solar photovoltaic from 2022 onwards is equal tot the system capacity of the installation. This means the maximal capacity with respect to the panel or the inverter. \n\n\nChanges as of June 7th 2024:\nRevised provisional figures of 2023 have been added.\n\nChanges as of March 7th 2024:\nProvisional figures of 2023 have been added.

    "short_description": "\nThis table comprises figures related to debt guarantees provided by the general government sector, adjusted capital value of off-balance sheet public private partnerships (PPP), and non-performing loans. The figures are also available per government subsector, and are taken from end-of-year balance sheets.\nThe non-performing loans are consolidated which means that loans between units that belong to the same sector are eliminated. As a result, non-performing loans of subsectors do not add up to total non-performing loans of general government. For example, loans of the State provided to local government are part of loans of the State. However, these are not included in the consolidated loans of general government, because it is an asset of a government unit with a government unit as debtor.\nPublication of this table meets one of the requirements of Directive EU 2011/85, part of the Enhanced Economic Governance package (\"Sixpack\") adopted by the European Council in 2011.\n\nData available from: situation on 31 December 2010.\n\nStatus of the figures:\nThe figures for 2023 are provisional. The figures for the earlier years are final.\n\nChanges as of 7 November 2024:\nProvisional figures for 2023 have been published.\nThe figures for 2022 have become final.\nThe figures for the period of 2010-2021 have been revised in the context of the revision policy of National accounts. The largest revision at the level of central government is mainly due to the reclassification of two guarantee funds Waarborgfonds Sociale Woningbouw (WSW) and Waarborgfonds Eigen Woningen (WEW) within this governmental sector.\n\nWhen will new figures be published?\nNew provisional figures for the previous year will be published in October. Previous provisional figures will then become definite. More information on the revision policy of National Accounts can be found under \"Relevant articles\" under paragraph 3.\n",

    "title": "Energy balance sheet; supply, transformation and consumption",
    "summary": "Energy, supply, transformation, consumption, final consumption\nNatural gas, electricity, petroleum, hard coal, renewable energy, heat",
    "period": "1946-2023",
    "short_description": "\nThis table shows the supply, transformation and the consumption of energy in a balance sheet. Energy is released - among other things - during the combustion of for example natural gas, petroleum, hard coal and biofuels. Energy can also be obtained from electricity or heat, or extracted from natural resources, e.g. wind or solar energy. In energy statistics all these sources of energy are known as energy commodities. \n\nThe supply side of the balance sheet includes indigenous production of energy, net imports and exports and net stock changes. This is mentioned primary energy supply, because this is the amount of energy available for transformation or consumption in the country.\n\nFor energy transformation, the table gives figures on the transformation input (amount of energy used to make other energy commodities), the transformation output (amount of energy made from other energy commodities) and net energy transformation. The latter is the amount of energy lost during the transformation of energy commodities. \n\nThen the energy balance sheet shows the final consumption of energy. First, it refers to the own use and distribution losses. After deduction of these amounts remains the final consumption of energy customers. This comprises the final energy consumption and non-energy use. The final energy consumption is the energy consumers utilize for energy purposes. It is specified for successively industry, transport and other customers, broken down into various sub-sectors. The last form of energy is the non-energy use. This is the use of an energy commodity for a product that is not energy.\n\nData available:\nFrom 1946.\n\nStatus of the figures:\nAll figures up to and including 2022 are definite. Figures for 2023 are revised provisional.\n\nChanges as of November 15th 2024:\nThe structure of the table has been adjusted. This concerns the classification into energy commodities, section 'other energy commodities'. The new classification ensures that it is now exactly in line with the classification used by Eurostat when publishing the Energy Balance Sheet. \nThis table has also been revised for 2015 to 2021 as a result of new methods that have also been applied for 2022 and 2023. This concerns the following components: final energy consumption of LPG, distribution of final energy consumption of motor gasoline and transfer of energy consumption of the nuclear industry from industry to the energy sector. The natural gas consumption of the wood and wood products industry has also been improved so that it is more comparable over time. This concerns changes of a maximum of a few PJ.\n\nChanges as of June 7th 2024:\nRevised provisional figures of 2023 have been added.\n\nChanges as of April 26th 2024:\n\n- Provisional figures of 2023 have been added.\n\nThe energy balance has been revised for 2015 and later on a limited number of points. The most important is the following:\n1. For solid biomass and municipal waste, the most recent data have been included. Furthermore data were affected by integration with figures for a new, yet to be published StatLine table on the supply of solid biomass. As a result, there are some changes in imports, exports and indigenous production of biomass of a maximum of a few PJ.\n2. In the case of natural gas, an improvement has been made in the processing of data for stored LNG, which causes a shift between stock changes, imports and exports of a maximum of a few PJ.\n3. Data for final energy consumption of blended biofuels per subsector in transport were incorrectly excluded. These have now been made visible.\n\nChanges as of March 25th 2024:\nThe energy balance has been revised and restructured. It concerns mainly a different way of dealing with biofuels that are mixed with fossil fuels.\n\nPreviously, biofuels mixed with fossil fuels were counted as petroleum crude and products. In the new energy balance, blended biofuels count for renewable energy and petroleum crude and products and the underlying products (such as gasoline, diesel and kerosene) only count the fossil part of mixtures of fossil and biogenic fuels. To make this clear, the names of the energy commodities have been adjusted. The consequence of this adjustment is that part of the energy has been moved from petroleum to renewable. The energy balance remains the same for total energy commodities. The aim of this adjustment is to make the increasing role of blended biofuels in the Energy Balance visible and to better align with the Energy Balances published by Eurostat and the International Energy Agency. Within renewable energy and biomass, pure and blended biofuels are now visible as separate energy commodities.\n\nIn addition, the way in which electric road transport is treated has been improved, resulting in an increase in the supply and final consumption of electricity in services by more than 2 PJ in 2021 and 2022.\n\nChanges as of November 14th 2023:\nFigures for 2021 and 2022 haven been adjusted.\nFigures for the Energy Balance for 2015 to 2020 have been revised regarding the following items:\n-\tFor 2109 and 2020 final consumption of heat in agriculture is a few PJ lower and for services a few PJ higher. This is the result of improved interpretation of available data in supply of heat to agriculture.\n-\tDuring the production of geothermal heat by agriculture natural gas is produced as by-product. Now this is included in the energy balance. The amount increased from 0,2 PJ in 2015 to 0,7 PJ in 2020.\n-\tThere are some improvements in the data for heat in industry with a magnitude of about 1 PJ or smaller.\n-\tThere some other improvements, also about 1 PJ or smaller.\n\n\nChanges as of October 10th 2023:\nEnergy commodity gas works cokes has been added.\nRevised figures for period 1946-1989 have been added.\n\nChanges as of June 15th 2023:\nRevised provisional figures of 2022 have been added.\n\nWhen will new figures be published?\nProvisional figures: April of the following year.\nRevised provisional figures: June/July of the following year.\nDefinite figures: December of the second following year.\n\n",

The correction concerns a slight upward revision of the number of self-employed persons. The cause was an error in the software that deduces whether someone is self-employed based on the answers in the questionnaire. As a result, for some records the position in the job remained unknown, whereas it should have been self-employed (with employees). This has now been corrected. \n\nChanges as of 14 June 2024:\nIn the previous version of this table, the 2022 figures for Saba and St Eustatius were swapped.

The average purchase price of existing own homes may differ from the price index of existing own homes. The average purchase price is no indicator for price developments of owner-occupied residential property. The average purchase price reflects the average price of dwellings sold in a particular period. The fact that de dwellings sold differs from one period to another is not taken into account. The following instance explains which problems are entailed by the continually changing of the quality of the dwellings sold. Suppose in February of a particular year mainly big houses with extensive gardens beautifully situated alongside canals are sold, whereas in March many small terraced houses are sold. In that case the average purchase price in February will be higher than in March but this does not mean that house prices are increased. See note 3 for a link to the article 'Why the average purchase price is not an indicator'.\n\nData available from: 1995\n\nStatus of the figures:\nThe figures in this table are immediately definitive. The calculation of these figures is based on the number of notary transactions that are registered every month by the Dutch Land Registry Office (Kadaster). A revision of the figures is exceptional and occurs specifically if an error significantly exceeds the acceptable statistical margins. The average purchasing prices of existing owner-occupied sold homes can be calculated by Kadaster at a later date. These figures are usually the same as the publication on Statline, but in some periods  they differ. Kadaster calculates the average purchasing prices based on the most recent data. These may have changed since the first publication. Statistics Netherlands uses figures from the first publication in accordance with the revision policy described above.\n\nChanges as of 23 February 2022:\nThe average purchase prices of the municipalities Bloemendaal and Blaricum in 2021 were incorrectly displayed. \nFor these municipalities the last digit (7th position) was omitted. These digits are added to the table.\n\nChanges as of 20 February 2024:\nAdded average purchase prices of the municipalities for the year 2023.\n\nWhen will new figures be published?\nNew figures are published approximately one to three months after the period under review. \n",

    "title": "Energy balance sheet; supply and consumption, sector",
    "summary": "Supply, consumption, energy transformation\nEnergy commodities, sector",
    "period": "1990-2023",
    "short_description": "\nThis table contains figures on the supply and consumption of energy broken down by sector and by energy commodity. The energy supply is equal to the indigenous production of energy plus the receipts minus the deliveries of energy plus the stock changes. Consumption of energy is equal to the sum of own use, distribution losses, final energy consumption, non-energy use and the total net energy transformation. For each sector, the supply of energy is equal to the consumption of energy.\n\nFor some energy commodities, the total of the observed domestic deliveries is not exactly equal to the sum of the observed domestic receipts. For these energy commodities, a statistical difference arises that can not be attributed to a sector.\n\nThe breakdown into sectors follows mainly the classification as is customary in international energy statistics. This classification is based on functions of various sectors in the energy system and for several break downs on the international Standard Industrial Classification (SIC). There are two main sectors: the energy sector (companies with main activity indigenous production or transformation of energy) and energy consumers (other companies, vehicles and dwellings). In addition to a breakdown by sector, there is also a breakdown by energy commodity, such as coal, various petroleum products, natural gas, renewable energy, electricity and heat and other energy commodities like non renewable waste.\n\nThe definitions used in this table are exactly in line with the definitions in the Energy Balance table; supply, transformation and consumption. That table does not contain a breakdown by sector (excluding final energy consumption), but it does provide information about imports, exports and bunkering and also provides more detail about the energy commodities.\n\nData available:\nFrom: 1990.\n\nStatus of the figures:\nFigures up to and including 2022 are definite. Figures for 2023 are revised provisional. \n\nChanges as of November 15th 2024:\nThe structure of the table has been adjusted. The adjustment concerns the division into sectors, with the aluminum industry now being distinguished separately within the non-ferrous metal sector.\nThis table has also been revised for 2015 to 2021 as a result of new methods that have also been applied for 2022 and 2023. This concerns the following components: final energy consumption of LPG, distribution of final energy consumption of motor gasoline, sector classification of gas oil/diesel within the services and transfer of energy consumption of the nuclear industry from industry to the energy sector. The natural gas consumption of the wood and wood products industry has also been improved so that it is more comparable over time. This concerns changes of a maximum of a few PJ.\n\nChanges as of June 7th 2024:\nRevised provisional figures of 2023 have been added.\n\nChanges as of April 26th of 2024\nThe energy balance has been revised for 2015 and later on a limited number of points. The most important is the following:\n1. For solid biomass and municipal waste, the most recent data have been included. Furthermore data were affected by integration with figures for a new, yet to be published StatLine table on the supply of solid biomass. As a result, there are some changes in receipts of energy, deliveries of energy and indigenous production of biomass of a maximum of a few PJ.\n2. In the case of natural gas, an improvement has been made in the processing of data for stored LNG, which causes a shift between stock changes, receipts of energy and deliveries of energy of a maximum of a few PJ.\n\nChanges as of March 25th of 2024:\nThe energy balance has been revised and restructured. This concerns mainly the following:\n1. Different way of dealing with biofuels that have been mixed with fossil fuels\n2. A breakdown of the natural gas balance of agriculture into greenhouse horticulture and other agriculture.\n3. Final consumption of electricity in services \n\n1. Blended biofuels\nPreviously, biofuels mixed with fossil fuels were counted as petroleum crude and products. In the new energy balance, blended biofuels count for renewable energy and petroleum crude and products and the underlying products (such as gasoline, diesel and kerosene) only count the fossil part of mixtures of fossil and biogenic fuels. To make this clear, the names of the energy commodities have been changed. The consequence of this adjustment is that part of the energy has been moved from petroleum to renewable. The energy balance remains the same for total energy commodities. The aim of this adjustment is to make the increasing role of blended biofuels in the Energy Balance visible and to better align with the Energy Balances published by Eurostat and the International Energy Agency. Within renewable energy, biomass, liquid biomass is now a separate energy commodity. This concerns both pure and blended biofuels.\n\n2. Greenhouse horticulture separately\nThe energy consumption of agriculture in the Netherlands largely takes place in greenhouse horticulture. There is therefore a lot of attention for this sector and the need for separate data on energy consumption in greenhouse horticulture. To meet this need, the agriculture sector has been divided into two subsectors: Greenhouse horticulture and other agriculture. For the time being, we only publish separate natural gas figures for greenhouse horticulture.\n\n3. Higher final consumption of electricity in services in 2021 and 2022.\nThe way in which electric road transport is treated has improved, resulting in an increase in the supply and final consumption of electricity in services by more than 2 PJ in 2021 and 2022. This also works through the supply of electricity in sector H (Transport and storage).\n\nChanges as of November 14th 2023:\nFigures for 2021 and 2022 haven been adjusted.\nFigures for the Energy Balance for 2015 to 2020 have been revised regarding the following items:\n-\tFor 2109 and 2020 final consumption of heat in agriculture is a few PJ lower and for services a few PJ higher. This is the result of improved interpretation of available data in supply of heat to agriculture.\n-\tDuring the production of geothermal heat by agriculture natural gas is produced as by-product. Now this is included in the energy balance. The amount increased from 0,2 PJ in 2015 to 0,7 PJ in 2020.\n-\tThere are some improvements in the data for heat in industry with a magnitude of about 1 PJ or smaller.\n-\tThere some other improvements, also about 1 PJ or smaller.\n\nChanges as of June 15th 2023:\nRevised provisional figures of 2022 have been added.\n\nChanges as of December 15th 2022:\nFigures for 1990 up to and including 2019 have been revised. The revision mainly concerns the consumption of gas- and diesel oil and energy commodities higher in the classification (total petroleum products, total crude and petroleum produtcs and total energy commodities).\nThe revision is twofold:\n-\tNew data for the consumption of diesel oil in mobile machine have been incorporated. Consequently, the final energy consumption of gas- and diesel oil in construction, services and agriculture increases. The biggest change is in construction (+10 PJ from 1990-2015, decreasing to 1 PJ in 2019. In agriculture the change is about 0.5-1.5 PJ from 2010 onwards and for services the change is between 0 and 3 PJ for the whole period.\n-\tThe method for dealing with the statistical difference has been adapted. Earlier from 2013 onwards a difference of about 3 percent was assumed, matching old data (up to and including 2012) on final consumption of diesel for road transport based on the dedicated tax specifically for road that existed until 2012. In the new method the statistical difference is eliminated from 2015 onwards. Final consumption of road transport is calculated as the remainder of total supply to the market of diesel minus deliveries to users other than road transport.\nThe first and second item affect both final consumption of road transport that decreases consequently about 5 percent from 2015 onwards. Before the adaption of the tax system for gas- and diesel oil in 2013 the statistical difference was positive (more supply than consumption). With the new data for mobile machines total consumption has been increased and the statistical difference has been reduced and is even negative for a few years.\n\n\nChanges as of 1 March 2022:\nFigures for 1990 up to and including 2020 have been revised. The most important change is a different way of presenting own use of electricity of power-generating installations. Previously, this was regarded as electricity and CHP transformation input. From now on, this is seen as own use, as is customary in international energy statistics. As a result, the input and net energy transformation decrease and own use increases, on average about 15 PJ per year. Final consumers also have power generating installations. That's why final consumers now also have own use, previously this was not so. In the previous revision of 2021, the new sector blast furnaces was introduced for the years 2015 up to and including 2020, which describes the transformation of coke oven coke and coking coal into blast furnace gas that takes place in the production of pig iron from iron ore. This activity was previously part of the steel industry. With this revision, the change has been put back to 1990.\n\n\nWhen will new figures be published?\nRevised provisional figures: June/July of the following year.\nDefinite figures: December of the second following year.\n\n",

Examples of this own use are the combustion of fuels in oil refinery steam boilers to produce steam that brings the refining process to the desired temperature, the consumption of electricity for pumping natural gas from the ground, the consumption of electricity for transporting hard coal in a coal plant and the consumption of electricity by a waste incinerator for flue gas cleaning."

    "short_description": "\nThis table contains information on the balance sheet of the general government sector. The balance sheet shows stock levels of assets and financial liabilities, as well as net worth of the general government sector. Assets are either financial (e.g. loans) or non-financial (e.g. non-residential buildings). The stock of assets equals the sum of the stock of financial liabilities and net worth. Stocks of assets and liabilities in this table are mostly valued at market value. This is the value of the asset or liability as if it were being acquired or sold on the date to which the balance sheet relates. When there are no observable market prices, estimates are made for the market value. Financial assets and liabilities that are not commonly traded on a market, such as cash, deposits, loans and other accounts receivable/payable are valued at nominal value.\n\nThe figures in this table are consolidated at the general government level. This means that stocks between units that both belong to the general government sector are eliminated.\n\nThe terms and definitions used are in accordance with the framework of the Dutch national accounts. National accounts are based on the international definitions of the European System of Accounts (ESA 2010). Small temporary differences with publications of the National Accounts may occur due to the fact that the government finance statistics are sometimes more up to date.\n\nData available from: 1995\n\nStatus of the figures:\nThe figures for the period 1995-2022 are final. The figures for 2023 are provisional.\n\nChanges as of 23 September 2024:\nAnnual figures for 2023 are available.\nThe financial assets and liabilities and the net saving and capital transfers of general government for 2022 have been revised due to updated information.\nIn the context of the revision policy of the National accounts the annual figures from 1995 of the financial accounts of general government have been revised.\nThe annual figures for 2022 are final.\n\nWhen will new figures be published?\nNew provisional data are published in July or August after the end of the reporting year. The previous provisional figures will become final and previous final figures can be revised at the same time.

Positive changes in the inventories occur when goods are produced during the accounting year, but are not sold yet. Additions also occur when goods are purchased in the accounting year, but not yet used in the production process. Negative changes in the inventories occur when goods are withdrawn from existing inventories to be sold or used in the production process. The valuation of the changes in inventories is calculated in such a way that no gains or losses to inventories are caused by price changes. For this purpose, the opening and closing inventories of each good are valued against the same price, namely raw materials against the average purchasing prices over that period, finished goods against the average selling price and work in progress against the average cost price. This valuation method reduces the possibilities that the production value - and with it the value added - is influenced by price changes in the inventories during the accounting period."

A distinction is made between, on the one hand, persons for whom self-employment provides for the main source of income, and on the other hand all persons with income from self-employed work. The figures in this table are broken down by type of self-employed person, sector, gender, age, migration background, position in the household, and by income and wealth decile groups.\n\nAll statistics in this table are at the individual level, this includes capital; (corporate) assets are summed per household and then assigned to all household members, thus serving as a measure of personal prosperity. The sample date for both population and capital is the first of January of the reporting year. For the older years 2007 up to and including 2010, capital is sampled on the first of January of the year following the reporting year.\n\nThe General Business Register (ABR) is used to determine the sector (SBI) of self-employed persons. The ABR has been subject to various trend breaks in the period 2007-2011. This leads to a sharp decrease in the number of self-employed persons in the financial services (sector K) in 2010. Therefore caution is advised when consulting sector trends or comparing numbers across sectors.\n\nData available from: 2007.\n\nStatus of the figures:\nThe figures for 2006 to 2022 are final. The figures for 2023 are preliminary.\n\nChanges as of November 1 2024:\nFigures for 2022 have been finalized. Figures for 2023 have been added.\n\nChanges as of March 2022:\nFigures on the wealth of the self-employed in 2010 were incorrect, and have been removed. For this year the wealth of 2011 applies, as 2011 marks a shift in sample date from December 31 to January 1. Missing wealth figures for 2013 have been supplemented.\n\nChanges as of July 2021:\nRevised data for 2006 to 2019 have been added.

    "short_description": "\nThis table shows the supply of electricity. Consumption of electricity is calculated from the supply variables. The supply of electricity primarily includes production plus imports minus exports. The majority of the electricity produced is supplied to the public electricity grid by, for example, power stations and wind turbines. A smaller part is generated by companies themselves for the benefit of their own business processes. For example, many greenhouse companies generate their own electricity for the lighting of their greenhouses. \n\nThe net production is determined as gross production minus the own consumption of electricity. Own consumption is the amount of electricity that a producer or installation consumes during electricity production. The net production is broken down in this table into the following energy sources from which the electricity is produced: nuclear energy, coal, petroleum products, natural gas, biomass, other fuels (non-renewable), hydro power, wind energy, solar photovoltaic and other sources. \n\nImports and exports are further broken down by country of origin or destination. \n\nThe total net consumption of electricity in the Netherlands is calculated as the net production plus imports minus exports and distribution losses. \n\nData available: \nFrom 1936 per year and from 1976 per month only the total production, imports and exports are known. \nFull data per month is available from 2015. \n\nStatus of the figures: \n- All figures up to and including reporting year 2022 are definite. \n- Figures for 2023 are revised provisional.\n- Figures for 2024 are provisional.\n\nChanges as of December 20th of 2024:\nFigures for October have been added.\n\nChanges as of November 29th of 2024:\nFigures for September have been added.\n\nChanges as of November 20th of 2024:\nThis table has been revised for 2015 to 2021 as a result of new methods that have also been applied for 2022 and 2023. This concerns changes of a maximum of a few PJ of the total supply and consumption on an annual basis. In addition, the figures for exports to Belgium in the first quarter of 2000 have been revised. Previously, exports to Belgium in the first quarter of 2000 were booked entirely in February. This has been corrected and divided over the months of January, February and March.\n\nChanges as of October 31st of 2024:\nFigures for August 2024 have been added.\n\nChanges as of October 1st of 2024:\nFigures for July 2024 have been added.\n\n\nWhen will new figures be published?\nProvisional figures: the second month after the end of the reporting period. \nRevised provisional figures: June of the year following the reporting year. \nDefinite figures: not later than November of the second following year.\n\n",

To a lesser extent, output of the general government is also sold on the market (P11), used as output for own final use (P12), or provided to the market as non-market output at prices that are not economically significant (P131):\r\nP1 = P11 + P12 + P131 + P132\r\nThe final consumption expenditure of the general government (P3) can be broken down into an individual (P31) and collective component (P32):\r\nP3 = P31 + P32\r\nThe individual consumption expenditure (P31) is equal to the social transfers in kind, which are individual goods and services supplied to individual households for free or at prices that are not economically significant, either produced as non-market output (D631) or purchased from market producers (D632):\r\nP31 = D631 + D632\r\nThe collective consumption expenditure (P32) are the costs associated with providing collective goods and services to society, or large parts of it, as a whole. In other words, this is the part of the non-market output that is provided for free (P132), which does not pertain to individual consumption expenditure (D631):\r\nP132 = D631 + P32\r\nThe relevant balancing items for the output and final consumption expenditure of the general government are as follows:\r\nB1n (Value added, net) = D1 + D29 (payable) + D39 (receivable) + B2n\r\nB1g (Value added, gross) = P1 \u2013 P2 = B1n + P51c"

To make time series and mutual comparison possible, 2020 will be published in 2 ways. In the 2014-2020 time series table 2020 is model-based using response data and auxiliary data from the tax authorities. The first quarter of 2021 has temporarily been added to the old 2014-2020 table awaiting the publication of the new table. With the release of the new table starting in 2020, the first quarter 2021 is no longer published in the old time series. \n\nAs of 2017 is the publication and revision policy of international trade in services review.\nThe figures on the Dutch international trade in services are available on quarterly and annual basis. Provisional quarterly figures are one quarter after the end of the reporting period available. With the publication of a new quarter, also the figures for the previous quarter and if applicable the other previous quarters of the year are adjusted on the basis of new source material (provisional figures). At the time of a year four quarters are available quarterly on the basis of these four figures a year calculation is made. This year calculation is available in the autumn of the following year. The year calculation is then adjusted again the following year, this time final. Also the quarterly figures of the year reviewed.\n\nChanges as of December 17, 2024:\nThe provisional figures of the second quarter 2024 have been adjusted and are revised provisional now, also the provisional figures of the third quarter 2024 have been added\n\nChanges as of November 19, 2024:\nIn the previously published data for 2022, the quarterly figures were reported correctly. However, an error occurred when calculating the total for the year, as the June data point was mistakenly used instead of the correct final quarterly figure. As a result, the quarterly figures did not add up to the published annual total. This error has now been corrected, ensuring that the published total aligns with the sum of the individual quarters.\n\nWhen will new figures be published?\nThe first figures become available approximately 12 weeks after the reporting period.\n\n",

Figures are presented in an absolute way, as well as related to the total energy use in the Netherlands.\nThe total gross final energy consumption in the Netherlands (the denominator used to calculate the percentage of renewable energy per \u2018Energy sources and techniques\u2019) can be found in the table as \u2018Total, including non-renewables\u2019 and Energy application \u2018Total\u2019. \nThe gross final energy consumption for the energy applications \u2018Electricity\u2019 and \u2018Heat\u2019 are also available. With these figures the percentages of the different energy sources and applications can be calculated; these values are not available in this table. \nThe gross final energy consumption for \u2018Transport\u2019 is not available because of the complexity to calculate this. More information on this can be found in the yearly publication \u2018Hernieuwbare energie in Nederland\u2019.\n\nRenewable energy is energy from wind, hydro power, the sun, the earth, heat from outdoor air and biomass. This is energy from natural processes that is replenished constantly.\n\nThe figures are broken down into energy source/technique and into energy application (electricity, heat and transport).\n\nThis table focuses on the share of renewable energy according to the EU Renewable Energy Directive. Under this directive, countries can apply an administrative transfer by purchasing renewable energy from countries that have consumed more renewable energy than the agreed target. For 2020, the Netherlands has implemented such a transfer by purchasing renewable energy from Denmark. This transfer has been made visible in this table as a separate energy source/technique and two totals are included; a total with statistical transfer and a total without statistical transfer.\n\nFigures for 2020 and before were calculated based on RED I; in accordance with Eurostat these figures will not be modified anymore. Inconsistencies with other tables undergoing updates may occur.\n\nData available from:\n1990\n\nStatus of the figures:\nThis table contains definite figures up to and including 2022 and figures of 2023 are revised provisional figures. \n\nChanges as of November 15th 2024\nFigures for 2021-2023 have been adjusted. 2022 is now definitive, 2023 stays revised provisional. Because of new insights for windmills regarding own electricity use and capacity, figures on 2021 have been revised.\n\n\nChanges as of June 7th 2024\nRevised provisional figures of 2023 have been added.\n\nChanges as of March 2024:\nFigures of the total energy applications of biogas, co-digestion of manure and other biogas have been restored for 2021 and 2022. The final energy consumption of non-compliant biogas (according to RED II) was wrongly included in the total final consumption of these types of biogas. Figures of total biogas, total biomass and total renewable energy were not influenced by this and therefore not adjusted. \n\nChanges as of November 2023:\nFigures of 2021 and 2022 have been updated. The status for figures of 2021 is now definite and the status for figures of 2022 is revised provisional.\nA new category \"Total, including non-renewables\" has been added from 1990 and further. Also the category \"Biokerosene\" has been added since 2022.\n\n\nWhen will new figures be published?\nProvisional figures on the gross final consumption of renewable energy in broad outlines for the previous year are published each year in June. Revised provisional figures for the previous year appear each year in June.\n\nIn November all figures on the consumption of renewable energy in the previous year will be published. These figures remain revised provisional, definite figures appear in November two years after the reporting year. Most important (expected) changes between revised provisional figures in November and definite figures a year later are the figures on solar photovoltaic energy. The figures on the share of total energy consumption in the Netherlands could also still be changed by the availability of adjusted figures on total energy consumption.\n\n",

This is the case when the separate branches or legal entities do not operate independently. Conversely, various sections may be discerned within a single legal entity, which operate independently in terms of production. On the basis of the definition, then, these sections constitute businesses in themselves. This last point mainly applies to larger concerns with diverse activities. When an entity so defined is active in different countries, for the purposes of national statistics the Dutch section is treated as a self-contained business.\r\n\r\nIn official Statistics Netherlands terminology, the company as defined here is known as a \"business unit\" (BU), in order to prevent confusion with the term \"business\" used in general terminology - which is, for these purposes, too imprecise.\r\n\r\nThe statistical unit of a business is an approximation of the kind-of-activity unit, as defined by Eurostat. This definition combines two requirements which may be in conflict: contribution to a single activity versus correlation with one or more operational units. When operationalising the statistical unit of a business, the Netherlands prioritises the second requirement."

        "Description": "Enterprise:\r\nThe actual transactor in the production process characterised by independence in deciding on that process and in offering its products to third parties.\r\n\r\nIt follows from this definition, and in particular from the element of independence, that an enterprise can comprise more than one establishment, but also more than one legal unit. (Legal units include both natural and legal persons.) This is the case when the separate establishments or legal units do not operate independently. Conversely, it is possible to distinguish between different parts within a legal unit that operate independently in terms of production. These then constitute as many enterprises as defined. The latter is especially the case for larger groups with diverse activities.\r\nWhen a unit thus defined extends over several countries, the Dutch part will be considered as a whole company for the sake of national statistics.\r\n\r\nIn official CBS terminology the enterprise as defined here is called the enterprise unit (BE), so that there is no confusion with the term enterprise used in common parlance, which is not very precise in this respect.\r\n\r\nThe statistical unit enterprise is an operationalisation of the kind-of-activity unit, as defined by Eurostat. This definition combines two requirements that may conflict: contributing to one activity versus corresponding to one or more operational units. The Netherlands gives priority to the second requirement when operationalising to the statistical enterprise unit."

        "Description": "Enterprise:\r\nThe actual transactor in the production process characterised by independence in deciding on that process and in offering its products to third parties.\r\n\r\nIt follows from this definition, and in particular from the element of independence, that an enterprise can comprise more than one establishment, but also more than one legal unit. (Legal units include both natural and legal persons.) This is the case when the separate establishments or legal units do not operate independently. Conversely, it is possible to distinguish between different parts within a legal unit that operate independently in terms of production. These then constitute as many enterprises as defined. The latter is especially the case for larger groups with diverse activities.\r\nWhen a unit thus defined extends over several countries, the Dutch part will be considered as a whole company for the sake of national statistics.\r\n\r\nIn official CBS terminology the enterprise as defined here is called the enterprise unit (BE), so that there is no confusion with the term enterprise used in common parlance, which is not very precise in this respect.\r\n\r\nThe statistical unit enterprise is an operationalisation of the kind-of-activity unit, as defined by Eurostat. This definition combines two requirements that may conflict: contributing to one activity versus corresponding to one or more operational units. The Netherlands gives priority to the second requirement when operationalising to the statistical enterprise unit."

        "Description": "Employer: \r\nEnterprises with employees. An enterprise is the actual transactor in the production process characterised by independence of decisions regarding that process and by offering its products to third parties. An enterprise is defined as an employer when in one year at least 0.5 FTE of labour force are on the payroll, excluding the director.\r\n\r\nIt follows from this definition and in particular from the independence element that an enterprise can comprise more than one establishment, but also more than one legal unit. (Legal units include both natural and legal persons). This is the case when the individual establishments or legal units do not operate independently. Conversely, it is possible to distinguish between different parts within a legal unit that operate independently in terms of production. These then constitute as many enterprises as defined. The latter is especially the case for larger groups with diverse activities.\r\nactivities. When a unit thus defined extends over several countries, the Dutch part is regarded as a whole company for the sake of national statistics.\r\n\r\nIn official CBS terminology the enterprise as defined here is called the enterprise unit (BE), so that there is no confusion with the term enterprise used in common parlance, which is not very precise in this respect.\r\n\r\nThe statistical unit enterprise is an operationalisation of the kind-of-activity unit, as defined by Eurostat. This definition combines two requirements that may conflict: contributing to one activity versus corresponding to one or more operational units. The Netherlands gives priority to the second requirement when operationalising to the statistical unit enterprise."

The volume change of GDP during a reference period expresses the growth or shrinkage of the economy. Gross domestic product at market prices is the final result of the production activity of resident producer units. It can be defined in three ways:\r\n- production approach: GDP is the sum of gross value added of the various institutional sectors or the various industries plus taxes and less subsidies on products (which are not allocated to sectors and industries). It is also the balancing item in the total economy production account;\r\n- expenditure approach: GDP is the sum of final uses of goods and services by resident institutional units (final consumption and gross capital formation), plus exports and minus imports of goods and services;\r\n- income approach: GDP is the sum of uses in the total economy generation of income account (compensation of employees, taxes on production and imports less subsidies, gross operating surplus and mixed income of the total economy).\r\n\r\nThe values are expressed at prices of the reporting period."

A woman is considered to be sexually active, if she has had sex, with a man, in the last 12 months. As of 2021, the question about contraceptive methods, other than the contraceptive pill, has changed. Where previously it was asked \u201cDo you currently use another method of contraception, for example condoms, a IUD or sterilization?\u201d, with the answer options 'yes', 'no' and 'no answer', from 2021 you will be asked \u201cDo you currently use (any) other contraception?\u201d, with the answer options 'no', 'yes condoms', 'yes, a copper IUD', 'yes, a hormone IUD', 'yes, you have been sterilized', 'yes your partner has been sterilized', 'yes another method' and 'no answer'. Explicitly naming the different methods as an answer option may have resulted in a higher number of yes answers. It is therefore not easy to compare figures on contraceptive use from 2020 and earlier with figures from 2021 and later. From 2023 onwards, questions about sexual activity indicate more clearly that it concerns sex with a man. This makes it clearer that women who have sex with women should answer 'no' to this question. This must be taken into account when interpreting the comparison of the 2023 figures on contraceptive use with previous figures."

    "short_description": "\nThis table provides up-to-date information about the opinions held by Dutch entrepreneurs on their achievements, expectations and judgments regarding their business. This panel is aimed at gaining insight into the current situation, future development and judgments of Dutch enterprises. As a result it is possible to detect turning points in optimism or pessimism at an early stage, providing an early indication of possible trend changes in the economic activities of Dutch enterprises. Data are broken down by region. The questions submitted to the entrepreneurs at the beginning of a quarter concern output, turnover, prices, order books, stocks, investments, competitive position, economic climate, staff size and the obstacles they have encountered. In answering the questions relating to developments in the past three months and expectations for the next three months, the entrepreneurs are asked for a comparison with the preceding period of three months.\n\nThe aggregation \u2018all enterprises (no finance or energy)\u2019 includes all available branches questioned in the Business Survey Netherlands. Because not every branch is questioned monthly, this aggregation will only have data available for the first month of each quarter. The aggregation \u2018C industry, H-S services and 45+47\u2019 includes all monthly questioned branches and serves as a subtotal of the monthly questionnaire.\n\nData available from: January 2012\n\nStatus of the figures: All figures are definitive.\n\nChanges as of November 28th 2024:\nFigures of November 2024 have been added.\n\nChanges as of March 7th 2024:\nDue to a technical issue most figures of February 2024 were divided by 100. This now has been corrected.\n\nWhen will new figures be published?\nFigures of December are expected to be published the 6th of January 2025.\n\n",

    "short_description": "\nThis table provides up-to-date information about the opinions held by Dutch entrepreneurs on their achievements, expectations and judgments regarding their business. This panel survey is aimed at gaining insight into the current situation, future development and the judgments of Dutch enterprises. As a result it is possible to detect turning points in optimism or pessimism at an early stage, providing an early indication of possible trend changes in the economic activities of the Dutch enterprises. Data are broken down by main business activities (SIC 2008) and size- classes. The questions submitted to the entrepreneurs at the beginning of a quarter concern output, turnover, prices, order books, stocks, investments, competitive position, economic climate, staff size and the obstacles they have encountered. In answering the questions relating to developments in the past three months and expectations for the next three months, the entrepreneurs are asked for a comparison with the preceding period of three months.\n\nThe aggregation \u2018all enterprises (no finance or energy)\u2019 includes all available branches questioned in the Business Survey Netherlands. Because not every branch is questioned monthly, this aggregation will only have data available for the first month of each quarter. The aggregation \u2018C industry, H-S services and 45+47\u2019 includes all monthly questioned branches and serves as a subtotal of the monthly questionnaire.\n\nData available from: January 2015\n\nStatus of the figures: All figures are definitive.\n\nChanges as of November 28th 2024:\nFigures of November 2024 have been added.\n\nChanges as of March 7th 2024:\nDue to a technical issue most figures of February 2024 were divided by 100. This now has been corrected.\n\nWhen will new figures be published?\nFigures of December are expected to be published the 6th of January 2025.\n\n",

Green maize is calculated at a humidity content of 65 percent.\r\n\r\nThe yield of cereals (wheat, barley, oats, rye and triticale) are calculated with a humidity degree of  15 percent.\r\n\r\nSince 2016, the yield of (turnip) rape seeds is based on a standardized moisture degree of 9 percent.

This data is supplied to Statistics Netherlands via the survey 'Informatie voor derden' (Iv3). The requirements for this survey are laid down in the 'Besluit Begroting en Verantwoording' (BBV).\n\nThe description of the tasks is laid down in the Directive for Budgeting and Accounting for provinces and municipalities (BBV), in the subsection called Information for third parties (Iv3). This description also applies to intergovernmental organisations, some tasks do not or only partially apply to intergovernmental organisations. In those cases where the word municipalities is mentioned in the description, this can be read as intergovernmental organisations.\n\nData available from: 2022\n\nStatus of the figures:\nThe figures in this table are provisional at the time of first publication. The figures become definitive when figures for the following year are added to the series.\n\nChanges as of 19 December 2024:\nThe provisional figures for 2023 have been added.\nThe figures for 2022 have been adjusted from provisional to definite.\n\nWhen will new figures be published?\nThe new figures from the local intergovernmental organisations accounts are published no later than 12 months after the reporting period.\nThe figures can be adjusted on the basis of the availability of new or updated source material. In general, the adjustments are small. The adjustments are made the moment a new annual figure is added to the series.\n",

At province level, the dwelling types are weighted by stock figures and then aggregated. At COROP-level, the dwelling types are not taken into account in the aggregation. The COROP areas Utrecht and Flevoland are equal to the eponymous provinces and are calculated according to the province procedure.

This statistic should include all companies that have been active for at least part of the reference period.\r\nEnterprise:\r\nThe actual transactor in the production process characterized by independence with respect to decisions about that process and by offering its products to third parties.\r\nIt follows from this definition and in particular from the element of independence that a business may have more than one establishment, but it can also have more than one legal entity (legal entities are understood to include both natural and legal persons). This is the case when the individual establishments or legal units do not operate independently. Conversely, it may be the case that within a legal unit there are several parts that operate independently in terms of production. Based on the definition, these then constitute as more than one enterprise. The latter occurs mainly in larger companies with diverse activities. When an enterprise thus extends over several countries, the Dutch part is regarded as a whole enterprise for the purposes of national statistics.\r\nIn the official CBS terminology, the enterprise as defined here is called business unit (BE), so that no confusion can arise with the term business in common parlance, which is not very precise in this respect.\r\nThe statistical unit business is an operationalization of the kind-of-activity unit, as defined by Eurostat. This definition combines two requirements that may conflict: contributing to one activity versus corresponding to one or more operational units. In operationalizing to the statistical unit enterprise, the Netherlands gives priority to the second requirement.\r\n"

The useful life threshold for qualifying assets may be increased if a longer expected useful life than one year is used as a threshold in the Company's accounting records.\r\nAll investments are valued gross (i.e., before value adjustments and before deduction of income from sales). Purchased goods are valued at the purchase price, i.e. including transport and installation costs, fees, taxes and other costs related to the transfer of ownership. Self-produced tangible goods are valued at the cost of production. Goods acquired as a result of restructurings (such as mergers, acquisitions and mergers or divestitures) are excluded. Purchases of small tools that are not fixed assets are included in current expenses.\r\nAlso included are all additions, alterations, improvements and renovations that extend the useful life or increase the productive capacity of capital assets.\r\nCurrent maintenance costs are excluded, as is the value of and current expenditure on capital assets used under rental and lease contracts. Investments in intangibles and financial assets are also excluded.\r\nWhen the invoicing, delivery, payment and first use of investments occur in different reference periods, the following method of recording should be sought:\r\n- Investment is recorded when ownership is transferred to the unit that intends to use the goods. \r\n- Capitalized production is recorded when it is produced. \r\n- In the case of investment made in identifiable stages, each partial investment should be recorded in the reference period in which it is made.\r\nIn practice, this is not always possible; in view of company accounting rules, one of the following approaches to this method may be needed:\r\n(a) investments are recorded in the reference period in which they are delivered,\r\n(b) investments are recorded in the reference period in which they are used in the production process,\r\n(c) investments are recorded in the reference period in which they are invoiced,\r\n(d) investments are recorded in the reference period in which they are paid for.\r\n"

The figures can be broken down by industry according to Statistics Netherlands' Standard Industrial Classification of all Economic Activities 2008 (SIC 2008). The change is shown both as a percentage change compared to a previous period and through index figures with 2021 as base year.\n\nTurnover and production changes are published in two forms. Firstly, as year-on-year changes where the growth is expressed relative to the same period in the previous year. These figures are presented unadjusted and calendar-adjusted. The second form represents period-on-period changes: month-on-month and quarter-on-quarter. Period-on-period changes are possible by applying seasonal adjustment.\n\nCurrently, this table exclusively comprises seasonally- and calendar adjusted data pertaining to monthly records for the retail sector. For other sectors, the unadjusted monthly series only extend back to January 2021, complicating the process of conducting adjustments. The lack of sufficient historical data makes it challenging to identify consistent patterns and trends, which is crucial for accurate adjustments. Some data may not be representative of all seasonal influences occurring over a longer period, potentially leading to less reliable or even incorrect adjustments. As the unadjusted monthly series lengthens, more reliable adjustments can be made. Therefore, in the spring of 2025, the table will be expanded to include seasonally- and calendar adjusted records for other sectors, retroactively from January 2021.\n\nData available from: January 2000 for branches within SIC division 47 and first quarter of 2005 for all other branches.\n\nStatus of figures:\nFigures for 2024 are provisional, other figures are final. \n\nThe figures of a calendar year become final no later than six months after the end of that calendar year. Due to delayed response, provisional figures may still change.\n\nChanges as of December 2, 2024:\nFigures of industries belonging to NACE sections G, H, I, J, L, M, N and S have been added. These are figures for the period October far as retail trade is concerned and September for other industries.\nFigures of the third quarter of 2024 may have been adjusted.\n\nTo keep the results of these index series in line with current events, a so-called base year change is carried out once every five years. In 2024, the publication of this table switched from reference year 2015 to 2021 (2021=100) and the weighting factors were updated and based on the year 2021. \n\nThis table combines data from 9 separate former tables. Which tables this concerns can be found later in this table explanation under \"3. Links to relevant tables and articles\".\n\nWhen are new figures released?\nFor monthly business statistics, figures are published as a rule 2 months after the end of the reporting month, figures for the retail trade sector and imports of new passenger cars and light commercial vehicles are published 1 month after the end of the reporting month. After publication of final results, Statistics Netherlands adjusts the figures only if major adjustments and/or corrections are necessary.\n\n",
