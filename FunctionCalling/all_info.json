The following (clusters of) diseases are used:\r\n-Asthma, chronic bronchitis\r\n-Heart condition\r\n-Stroke\r\n-Hypertension\r\n-Disturbance of stomach-intestines\r\n-Diabetes\r\n-Disorder of the back\r\n-Rheumatic or joint disorder\r\n-Migraine\r\n-Cancer\r\nPeople are considered to be chronically diseased when they indicate to suffer from at least one of these diseases, within the last 12 months.\r\nThe questions on chronic diseases are being asked at persons of 0 years or older. However, there are some exceptions. The questions on heart diseases, stroke, hypertension and joint degeneration are only being asked at persons of 12 years and older. In the calculation of life expectancy without chronic morbidity it is therefore assumed that these diseases do not occur amongst persons younger than 12 years.\r\nThe data of the years 1981 through 2000 have been repaired. More information about this repair can be found in the table explanation."

        "Description": "The number of years a person of a certain age can (still) expect to live without psychological complaints. Figures on this variant of healthy life expectancy will no longer be provided from statistical year 2024 onwards.\r\nThe calculation of psychological complaints is, until 2023, based on the scores on the Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5). Therefore the following questions of the health survey are used:\r\nDuring the past 4 weeks, how much of the time.:\r\n-Have you been a very nervous person?\r\n-Did you feel depressed?\r\n-Have you felt calm and peaceful?\r\n-Have you felt downhearted and blue?\r\n-Were you a happy person?\r\nThe possible answers to these questions are: 'all of the time', 'most of the time', 'a good bit of the time', 'some of the time', 'a little of the time' and 'non of the time'. Positively phrased questions are scored respectively 5,4,3,2,1 and 0. Negatively phrased questions are scored 0,1,2,3,4 and 5. For every respondent a sum score is being calculated\r\nwhich is multiplied by 4. Therefore the minimum score of a person is 0 (very unhealthy) and the maximum score is 100 (perfectly healthy. Every respondent with a score of 60 or more is considered to have no psychological complaints.\r\nThe questions of the Mental Health Inventory are only asked to people aged 12 and older. In the calculation of the life expectancy without psychological complaints\r\n the assumption is made that children younger than 12 years have the same prevalence of psychological complaints as people of 12 through 14 years.\r\nUp to 2023, life expectancy without psychological complaints was referred to as life expectancy in good mental health.\r\nResearchers from the Trimbos Institute recalibrated the MHI in 2024 and determined that the previously used cut-off point of 60 was no longer adequate for a number of reasons. It was also determined that the indicator \u2018psychological distress\u2019 would be better replaced by the indicator \u2018feelings of anxiety or depression\u2019, where an MHI sum score of 76 or lower determines whether or not you have those feelings. As of 10 September 2024, the indicator \u2018feelings of anxiety or depression in the past 4 weeks\u2019 will therefore replace the indicator \u2018psychological distress in the past 4 weeks\u2019. More information about the recalibration of the MHI can be found in a fact sheet from the Trimbos Institute (see table explanation). The variable \u2018Psychological distress\u2019 will therefore no longer be supplemented from 2024 onwards. As a result, the indicator on life expectancy psychological complaints will also no longer be supplemented from statistical year 2024 onwards. The CBS will not calculate a healthy life expectancy based on the variable \u201cFeelings of anxiety or depression in the past 4 weeks\u201d.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

PPPs entail  significant capital expenditure to create or renovate fixed assets by the corporation, which then operates and manages the assets to produce and deliver services either to the government unit or to the general public on behalf of the government unit.\r\n\r\nIn a PPP contract, the corporation acquires the fixed assets and is the legal owner of these assets during the contract period, in some cases with the backing of the government. The contract often requires the assets to meet the design, quality, and capacity specified by government, to be used in the manner specified by government to produce the services required by the contract, and to be maintained in accordance with standards defined by government.\r\nAs with leases, the economic owner of the assets in a PPP is determined by assessing which unit bears the majority of the risks and which unit is expected to receive a majority of the rewards of the assets.

If the majority of the risk is for the partner, then the assets are on the partner\u2019s balance sheet and off the balance of the government sheets.

The assets and revenues of that legal unit (the debtor) are then taken to pay off the debts. The bankruptcy can be pronounced at the request of a creditor, the debtor himself or the Public Prosecution Service. After the income and assets have been paid out to creditors, the bankruptcy is terminated but the debtor is often not debt-free. Residual debts remain due and payable. The bankruptcy of a legal entity at the request of a creditor can only be made if there is also a debt to another creditor."

In that case the average purchase price in February will be higher than in March but this does not mean that house prices are increased."

This includes unfinished dwellings, non-residential buildings and civil engineering works. Positive changes in the inventories occur when goods are produced during the accounting year, but are not sold yet. Additions also occur when goods are purchased in the accounting year, but not yet used in the production process. Negative changes in the inventories occur when goods are withdrawn from existing inventories to be sold or used in the production process. The valuation of the changes in inventories is calculated in such a way that no gains or losses to inventories are caused by price changes. For this purpose, the opening and closing inventories of each good are valued against the same price, namely raw materials against the average purchasing prices over that period, finished goods against the average selling price and work in progress against the average cost price. This valuation method reduces the possibilities that the production value - and with it the value added - is influenced by price changes in the inventories during the accounting period."

This is the case when the separate branches or legal entities do not operate independently. Conversely, various sections may be discerned within a single legal entity, which operate independently in terms of production. On the basis of the definition, then, these sections constitute businesses in themselves. This last point mainly applies to larger concerns with diverse activities. When an entity so defined is active in different countries, for the purposes of national statistics the Dutch section is treated as a self-contained business.\r\n\r\nIn official Statistics Netherlands terminology, the company as defined here is known as a \"business unit\" (BU), in order to prevent confusion with the term \"business\" used in general terminology - which is, for these purposes, too imprecise.\r\n\r\nThe statistical unit of a business is an approximation of the kind-of-activity unit, as defined by Eurostat. This definition combines two requirements which may be in conflict: contribution to a single activity versus correlation with one or more operational units. When operationalising the statistical unit of a business, the Netherlands prioritises the second requirement."

        "Description": "The figures relate to the Mental Health Inventory 5 or \ua78cMHI-5\ua78c. This is an international standard for a specific measuring of psychological distress, consisting of 5 questions. MHI-5 is actually an extract of \ua78cShort Format 36\ua78c (SF-36), an elaborate international standard for measuring health. MHI-5 deals with questions related to how one felt during the last 4 weeks. The following questions were asked:\r\n1. Did you feel very nervous?\r\n2. Were you so down in the dump that nothing could cheer you up?\r\n3. Did you feel calm and quiet?\r\n4. Did you feel depressed and down?\r\n5. Were you happy?\r\n\r\nEvery question has the following 6 answer categories: all the time, most of the time, often, sometimes, rarely, and never. The answer categories in positively worded questions of the MHI questionnaire (questions 3 and 5) have been consequently awarded the values 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 and 0. The answer categories in negatively worded questions (questions 1, 2 ad 4) have been awarded the turned-down values. Next, per person the sum scores have been calculated and multiplied by 4, so that the minimum sum score of a person can be 0 (very unhealthy) and the maximum score 100 (perfectly healthy). A score of 60 or more means that a respondent has no psychological distress. \r\n\r\nA score of less than 60 means that  a person does have psychological distress.\r\nUntil 2023, instead of \u2018psychological distress\u2019, the term \u2018poor mental health\u2019 was used.\r\n\r\nHowever, researchers at the Trimbos Institute determined in 2024 that the cut-off point of 60 as previously used was no longer sufficient for a number of reasons. The previous determination of the cut-off value of the MHI-5 used a method that depends on the prevalence of mental disorders. Because the prevalence has proven to be variable, this cut-off value is no longer sufficient. Furthermore, the classification of mental disorders has changed since the previous cut-off value determination: the DSM-5 is currently used, while the old cut-off value was based on the criteria of DSM-III-R. More information about recalibration of the MHI can be found in the fact sheet of the Trimbos Institute (see table explanation).\r\n\r\nThe variable 'Psychological distress, past 4 weeks' will therefore no longer be supplemented from 2024 and from September 2024 CBS will only include the series on the variable Feelings of anxiety or depression, 4 wks (last 4 weeks).\r\n"

A woman is considered to be sexually active, if she has had sex, with a man, in the last 12 months. As of 2021, the question about contraceptive methods, other than the contraceptive pill, has changed. Where previously it was asked \u201cDo you currently use another method of contraception, for example condoms, a IUD or sterilization?\u201d, with the answer options 'yes', 'no' and 'no answer', from 2021 you will be asked \u201cDo you currently use (any) other contraception?\u201d, with the answer options 'no', 'yes condoms', 'yes, a copper IUD', 'yes, a hormone IUD', 'yes, you have been sterilized', 'yes your partner has been sterilized', 'yes another method' and 'no answer'. Explicitly naming the different methods as an answer option may have resulted in a higher number of yes answers. It is therefore not easy to compare figures on contraceptive use from 2020 and earlier with figures from 2021 and later. From 2023 onwards, questions about sexual activity indicate more clearly that it concerns sex with a man. This makes it clearer that women who have sex with women should answer 'no' to this question. This must be taken into account when interpreting the comparison of the 2023 figures on contraceptive use with previous figures."

This explains why the gross yield does not equal the commercial production.\r\n\r\nThe humidity degree of arable crop products such as cereals, oilseeds and plants harvested green can vary to a great extent, and thereby lead to variations in production across the years. In order to get a good estimate of the actual \u2018dry\u2019 yield and in order to harmonize data across multiple years, the yields per hectare and the gross yield (total) are recalculated with a standardized humidity degree.\r\n\r\nThe yields of grain maize and corn cob mix have been calculated with a standardized humidity percentage  of 35 percent. Green maize is calculated at a humidity content of 65 percent.\r\n\r\nThe yield of cereals (wheat, barley, oats, rye and triticale) are calculated with a humidity degree of  15 percent.\r\n\r\nSince 2016, the yield of (turnip) rape seeds is based on a standardized moisture degree of 9 percent. The yield of the years prior to 2016 are based on the actual humidity degree in the relevant year. These humidity levels can be found in the database published on Eurostat. \r\ns."

This is the case when the individual establishments or legal units do not operate independently. Conversely, it may be the case that within a legal unit there are several parts that operate independently in terms of production. Based on the definition, these then constitute as more than one enterprise. The latter occurs mainly in larger companies with diverse activities. When an enterprise thus extends over several countries, the Dutch part is regarded as a whole enterprise for the purposes of national statistics.\r\nIn the official CBS terminology, the enterprise as defined here is called business unit (BE), so that no confusion can arise with the term business in common parlance, which is not very precise in this respect.\r\nThe statistical unit business is an operationalization of the kind-of-activity unit, as defined by Eurostat. This definition combines two requirements that may conflict: contributing to one activity versus corresponding to one or more operational units. In operationalizing to the statistical unit enterprise, the Netherlands gives priority to the second requirement.\r\n"
